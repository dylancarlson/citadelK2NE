93Apr03  Version 6.05 released.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
93Apr07  Work opened on V6.06.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr08  Telnet session and user now displays on console
         status line.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr08  "#" command added - prompts user as to how many messages
         the user wants to read, then reads starting at that many
         messages "back" from the newest message in a room.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr08  Removed ".rm" command - the "#" command makes it
         rather superfluous, redundant and tautological.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr08  Telnet sessions now support ANSI codes passed through from
         remote host to online user.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr10  In Mail>, "broadcast messages" to "Citadel" will now display
         as being "to All System Users" when read by their recipients.
         There is no change concerning who may enter such messages.  (VAQ)
93Apr10  Removed ".<A>ide <I>nsert-msg" as an available command.
         Everything it does can be done through other Aide commands
         so "out it goes."  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr10  List of users for .<R>ead <I>nvited now displays in columnized
         format keyed to logged-in Aide's terminal width variable.  (VAQ)
93Apr14  New users are now asked to provide real name, address, city,
         state, ZIPcode and phone number at first login.  This is stored
         to file CTDLUSER.# where # is the user's log-slot number assigned
         by Citadel during the initial login process.  This information
         can be flagged by the user as PUBLIC or PRIVATE.  If PUBLIC,
         the information is displayed to any user doing a ".U" profile
         request.  (VAQ, SMW)

         REQUIRED UTILITY UPDATE: UserBio.Exe dated 93Apr14 or later.

93Apr14  Users can now add/change their Registration information by
         using the ".ECR" command sequence.  The user is shown the
         present information contained in CTDLUSER.# (see previous
         note) and advised of the Public/Private status of the information.
         The user is then asked to confirm changing the information, and
         if so requested, the user is then brought through the information
         gathering process and a new CTDLUSER.# file is created.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr15  Removed ".eu" command for user entering/changing of PROFILE
         statements.  Replaced with ".p".  Also added "p" at any room-
         prompt for reading user PROFILE statements.  ".RU" removed,
         since it would be silly to have duplication!  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr15  Added option to flag network nodes for telnet access.  This is
         done by automatic question/response when adding a new node,
         or by "CTRL L, N, E, nodename, T" sequence for pre-existing
         nodes.  Network nodes that are "telnet accessible" will display
         with an asterisk immediately before the Country Code in their
         node ID strings when a nodelist is invoked.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr18  Version 6.06 released.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
