90Apr18  Added support for READ-ONLY rooms, including "R" option in the
         "Aide Edit Room" command-list to set/unset the READ_ONLY bit
         Only a remote sysop (or sysop at the console) can use this
         command.  A logged-in remote sysop is still able to enter
         messages to read-only rooms.  Note that a room can only be
         set to READ_ONLY if you can EDIT the room, which eliminates
         the BaseRoom, Mail, and Aide.  Acknowledgement here must go to
         Dave Parsons (Orc) as it was on his STadel systems that I
         first encountered a read-only room on a Citadel.  (VAQ)
90May15  Added code to support checking BADUSERS.SYS in the
         HomeArea directory when a new user logs on via modem.
         New user name is checked against contents of this file
         and if a match is found the new user is politely disconnected
         and his information is NOT saved.  This only happens when
         you have the system set up in such a manner as to present
         the new user with the terminal options choices at login.
         Since some of the restricted login modes never reach this
         code, they also will not check BADUSERS.SYS, however those
         modes also never write to the log file.  (VAQ)
90Jun16  General code-tightening to shorten executable file size
         and fix a small bug.  (VAQ)
90Jun20  Release of V5.11.  (VAQ)
