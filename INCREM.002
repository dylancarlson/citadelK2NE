88Aug17: Force Citadel to spell-out "windowed" if user selects windowed
         xmodem protocol for up/down-loading. (VAQ)
88Aug17: Completed hack using mini-Interpreter for ctdlcnfg.sys to send
         AT[return] and then the modem init string at completion of
         each call, including net calls.  Seems to work fine with the
         Avatex 2400 external modem, and resets modem to 2400bps after
         hangup of modem, even for net calls. (VAQ)
88Aug17: Completed additions/corrections to source code to clean up
         problems in the auto-baudrate-detection routines.  This was
         using Fountain PC/XT-Turbo with Multifunction card
         and Avatex 2400 external.  Also tested at 1200bps using the
         Columbia PC with its modem port and Avatex 1200HC external.
         Also tested at 2400bps installed at "Outside the Asylum" node
         running the Supra 2400bps external modem.  (AB and VAQ)
88Aug18: runHangup() function added to CTRL-L 'R' [in CTDL.C]
         to force flush of modem input buffer when re-initializing
         the modem.  Should be done whenever chatmode is used to
         out-dial. (VAQ)
88Aug18: Modified the screen message and modem message for system
         crashes - took out the "leave mail on Test Sys" to help
         keep things straight!  Also, simulated DOS prompt to user
         on crash exit. (VAQ)
<><><><><><><><><> Beginning of Ver. 3.09.08:K2NE <><><><><><><><><><><><>
88Aug20: Changed report on Buffers to simply report number of characters
         in the RS232 in_buffer at carrier detect. (VAQ)
88Aug21: Add "M" and ".M" to bring user directly to Mail>. (VAQ)
88Aug22: Phone library and dialing utility functions created and merged
         with CTDL.EXE, with new files {ABPHONE.C, WIN.C, KEYS.H, WIN.H}
	 callable from the Sysop Options menu. (AB)
88Aug22: Phone library deactivated from main system unless "+phone" is
         used as command-line parameter when running CTDL. (VAQ)
88Aug24: Display availability of Phone library at bootup and between
         user calls. (VAQ)
88Aug24: Moved netReader() and logReader() into AB.C. (VAQ)
88Aug24: Created ".AB" command combining effects of ".ADS" and
         ".ADN" which may eventually disappear. (VAQ)
88Aug25: Moved status bar to bottom of screen.  Also, added name of
         last logged-in user as part of the ".RS" report.  Slightly
         modified the format of the lead-in screen when no BANNER.BLB
         is present - this was needed to keep AnytimeNet Receive
         screwed on tightly. (VAQ and AB)
88Aug26: First draft of Doors conceived. (AAB and VAQ)
<><><><><><><><><> Beginning of Ver. 4.01:K2NE <><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
88Aug26: Door Utility written as ABDOOR.C; Door batchfiles written;
         TSR carrier-detect problem solved; Doors installed at
         Jersey Devil for testing. (AAB and VAQ)
88Aug27: Doors installed at Alternative Reality for testing. (AAB)
88Aug27: Added "W" (Who ELSE is here?) to print userlist. (VAQ)
88Aug28: "W" command modified - only works if logged in. (VAQ)
88Aug28: New Doors interfacing code written, installed, debugged. (AAB)
88Aug29: Extra linefeed "problem" while in a door determined to be
         dependent on the user terminal and not the door or Citadel. (VAQ)
88Sep01: Extensions to the ".k" command to permit displaying known
         rooms by type (directory, private, anonymous, forgotten,
         networked, and by user-provided match-string. (AAB)
88Sep02: ".k" code patched to show "knownopt.mnu" menu file to user
         if user selects "?".  Also, cosmetic improvements to the
         ".kr" option. (VAQ)
88Sep03: "QuickNet" code written and debugged (mostly!).  Sysop can
         force Anytime-Net session from CTRL-L menu by selecting
         option "Q" (QuickNet) -- only from local sysConsole, and
         should NOT be logged-in.  If sysop is logged in, Citadel
         will treat it as a ".TA" session since QuickNet will return
         to MODEM/no-user mode after net is done.  This option only
         polls nodes that are in your Anytime Net net# (and presumably
         you should have only one such net type).  If no work needs to
         be done, no net session occurs. (VAQ)
88Sep05  Removed a nasty bug in the QuickNet routines. (VAQ)
88Sep08  Some cosmetic modification done in order to reduce
         executable code size. (BR)
88Sep09  SEEMAIL routines made optional to the compiler by #IFNDEF
         directives. (BR)
88Sep10  Zenith-specific files and routines made optional via
         #IFDEF directives.  Code can now be compiled for true PC
         compatables without the CITZEN module. (BR)
88Sep10  Sysop can exit the networker in between net calls by
         using ESC key.  Option "I" removed from Sysop menu. (BR)
88Sep11  Opening screen cleaned up so initial scroll-bar looks
         more organized for Herc monographics systems. (VAQ)
88Sep14  #ifdef MSG_FINDER added to disable CTRL L "Y" feature
         unless selected by compiler preprocessor or by defining
         MSG_FINDER in the MAKEfile. (VAQ)
88Sep14  Added SPACEBAR as acceptable user input to <P>ause
         system type-out. (VAQ)
88Sep17  #ifdef and #ifndef HUE_STYLE added (CTDL.C).  This makes the
         new-style Video (inverse video status bar in place of
         username above room-prompt etc.) the default when
         compiling.  To do it Twin-Cities style, define HUE_STYLE
         in the MAKEfile prior to compiling. (VAQ)
88Sep17  Replaced hardcoded message with file "holdbuff.blb" in
         #HELPAREA directory to tell user there is a message in
         his holding buffer at login. (VAQ)
88Sep19  Changed format of net roster to present "need to call" status
         and "disabled" status in more readable format. (VAQ)
88Sep23  Fixed bug in AB.C that could crash system if user attempted
         to view node list by pressing "?" after ".EN" in the
         mail room.  We now check for existence of NETPATH.SYS
         and if not present, return from function cleanly. (VAQ)
88Sep24  Optional compile of Debug switch in CTDL.C using
         "#ifdef DEVELOP_VERSION" which also optionalizes other
         code involving reporting Debug status to console/modem. (VAQ)
88Sep26  Modified code so that unlogged users can always read in
         LOBBY (baseroom) regardless of setting of READOK. (VAQ)
88Oct03  Released Ver 4.01 (AB, VAQ, BR)
