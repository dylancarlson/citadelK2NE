91Oct28  Released V6.01  (VAQ)
91Oct28  Removed "Re-init Modem" from Sysop Commands.  It is much
         easier to just press ESC then do a ".TQ" from the console,
         which resets the modem also.  Resetting the modem via
         remote is suicidal in any event, and not needed!  (VAQ)
91Nov01  Added parameter #MODEMIDLE to CTDLCNFG.SYS.  Usage is
         #MODEMIDLE "string".  Citadel will send "string" to the
         modem when sysop presses ESC to enter console mode when
         there is no user online.  This will enable those sysops
         who own modems that insist on answering the phone with
         DTR suppressed to send a string to the modem commanding
         it to not answer incoming calls.  (VAQ)
91Nov02  Entry of file descriptions prior to uploading now utilizes
         standard Citadel editor.  (VAQ)
91Nov05  Added code to allow Citadel to handle the job of answering
         the line instead of modem "ring counts."  In order to do this,
         your modem MUST return a NUMERIC value of "2" every time the
         line rings.  First, in your #modemSetup string, use whatever
         your modem needs to tell it to return NUMERIC ("nonVerbose")
         result codes, then (also in #modemSetup) tell it NOT to answer
         the phone (usually by using the equivalent of the Hayes
         command "S0=0").  Next, use the command-line parameter
         "rings=n" for CTDL.EXE in the batchfile that handles your BBS,
         where "n" is the number of rings you want before the BBS
         answers the line.  Just ignore all of this stuff if you want
         Citadel to continue to handle answering the line in
         the "traditional" manner.  (VAQ)
91Nov05  Added optional configuration parameter #MODEMANSWER [string]
         which, if used, will make a record of the string you want to use
         when you want Citadel to make the modem do the job of answering
         the line (see previous note).  If missing it defaults to "ATA".
         Usage:  #MODEMANSWER "string"  with no "\r" or "\n" needed.  (VAQ)
91Nov08  The daily cumulative activity totals are displayed in a window
         while the system is waiting for a call.  (VAQ)
91Nov09  Network information now displays in a scrolling window on
         the console screen.  Just a fluff, but a nice one.  (VAQ)
91Nov11  Network nodelist (with indicators for work-pending) is now
         windowed (via the F3 key) from the console (while waiting
         between calls).  (VAQ)
91Nov15  Adjusted code that handles the console status-bar for proper
         operation when Citadel is first brought up.  Also, tightened
         all window-oriented code for the networker, net status reports,
         and pending-events (ALT-A) windows.  (VAQ)
91Nov18  If you have Citadel set up so that Citadel handles answering the
         phone (see note for 91NOV05) you will hear a "ring-tone" from your
         computer speaker when the phoneline is ringing.  This may be
         defeated by putting the parameter "noringer" on your CTDL.EXE
         command-line.  (VAQ)
91Nov21  Added CTDL.EXE parameter "nonoises" for those that want to
         shut off the ringer AND the "exploding windows" sound-effects.  (VAQ)
91Nov22  ALT-X to exit to DOS is now in a console window.  It will accept
         a Y or N but otherwise will burp at you!  (VAQ)
91Nov29  Beginning with V6.02, all standby-screen displays will use
         ANSI option, therefore #ANSICONSOLE setting is no longer relevant
         and will be pulled from CTDLCNFG.SYS with the next revision that
         "demands" an upgrade of the Configurator (CONFG.EXE).  Meanwhile,
         you should set #ANSICONSOLE to 1 in order to avoid possible ugliness
         in case there is some of the older code "lurking about."
         The release package for V6.02 will contain a "freshly recompiled"
         version of CONFG.EXE to handle those "just in case" bugs which
         like to surface here and there.  Note also that beginning with
         V6.02 you MUST have ANSI.SYS loaded as a device-driver in your
         DOS CONFIG.SYS file.  (VAQ)
91Dec01  Network problems with V6.02 (hopefully!) debugged.  (VAQ)
91Dec07  Released V6.02.  (VAQ)
