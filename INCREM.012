90Jun20  Release of V5.11.  (VAQ)
90Jun24  Added code to support the ".RM" command, which allows users to
         read an individual message in a room by entering its message
         number.  Command displays available range of message numbers
         and prompts for user choice.  (VAQ)
90Jun25  Added ".R#" - does the same thing as ".RM" - to see which
         command is preferred by users.  (VAQ)
90Jun29  Added message-numbers to header displays.  (VAQ)
90Jul04  Added <Q>uikHeaders command - displays the headers for
         messages in current room.  As extended command, employs
         the same options as the ".r" command.  (VAQ)
90Jul07  Made cosmetic improvement to ".rm" and ".r#" commands.  (VAQ)
90Jul15  Added "logtry=nn" parameter.  If present, the integer value of
         "nn" determines the number of bad login attempts before the
         system drops carrier on the caller.  Defaults to 20 if not
         used.  Example: logtry=3 will hang up on the caller after the
         third bad login attempt.  Before dropping carrier on the
         unsuccessful caller, the system will type-out BADHACK.BLB if
         it is present in the HelpArea directory.  (VAQ)
