90Oct24  Released V5.13.  (VAQ)
90Nov23  Added code to prompt user during reading of LOGTEXT.### files
         for those users who want to avoid reading bulletins.  The
         prompt will NOT appear after LOGTEXT.024, so if you want your
         system to "look pretty" you should a) have at least one
         LOGTEXT file on hand and b) make sure that your last LOGTEXT
         file is named LOGTEXT.024.  I didn't test this to see what would
         happen if there are no LOGTEXT files.  If this proves to be a
         problem, or even a major annoyance, just let me know and I will
         fix it up.  (VAQ)
90Nov24  Added code to allow users to toggle message numbers on/off in
         message headers.  Command is ".ecm" with new user account
         defaulting to ON.  This should keep the CitaPurists happy!  (VAQ)
90Nov24  Completed code-tightening resulting in saving of about 4K
         in CTDL.EXE file-size.  (VAQ)
90Nov25  System will now determine if a user has already called "today"
         and if so, will only show the user the LOGTEXT.### files on the
         first call of the day.  (VAQ)
90Nov25  Added support to show users files BULLETIN.000 thru BULLETIN.024
         prior to showing the LOGTEXT.### files.  This covers the case of
         a sysop who wants each user to read file(s) at login regardless
         of how many calls per day the user has made.  The sequence is
         as follows:
             a) type out BULLETIN.000 thru BULLETIN.024 to the logged-in
                user if the files exist, prompting for continuation after
                each file.
             b) check to see if this is the first call of the day for
                the current user, and if so, type out LOGTEXT.000 thru
                LOGTEXT.024 if the file(s) exist, prompting for
                continuation after each file.
         The files BULLETIN.### and LOGTEXT.### go in the HELPAREA
         directory.  Citadel will manage resetting the "first call of
         the day" business by itself when the date changes.  This data
         is stored in DAYUSERS.SYS, which resides in the HOMEAREA
         directory.  If you add a new LOGTEXT file, you can force users
         to read the LOGTEXT files by simply deleting DAYUSERS.SYS
         before you bring up the BBS.  (VAQ)
90Nov27  A cute bit of fluff!  Modified the 'w' command ("Who ELSE is
         here") to work outside of the Mail> room, but when used outside
         of Mail> it accesses the DAYUSERS.SYS file and displays the names
         of today's callers.  Nothing dramatic, and probably very much
         unCitadel, but... cute!  (VAQ)
90Nov28  Added code to read list of today's users (DAYUSERS.SYS contents)
         by pressing ALT-L while system is "waiting for next call."  (VAQ)
