91Jan12  Version 5.15 released.  (VAQ)
91Jan12  Code added to support operation of a Citadel node as a
         FIDOnet "gateway" node.  In such cases, rooms that are
         edited to be "gateway" rooms must also be Citadel-net
         "shared" rooms as well as FIDOnet "external-net linked"
         rooms.  Once this has been done, you can now set such
         a room to act as a "gateway" using "<A>ide-edit room <G>ateway"
         which will cause messages received into that room from
         other Citadel nodes to be exported to the linked FIDOnet
         conference attached to that room.  Yes, this all sounds
         confusing as hell!  Also, CITAGATE has been modified to
         support this feature, and you must have CITAGATE ver 1.03
         (or newer) to use your Citadel system as a FIDOnet Gateway.
         There are also things you must negotiate with the FIDOnet
         coordinator(s) before activating yourself as a Gateway
         (they are much more structured than Citadel Net -- politics!).  (VAQ)
91Jan13  Code added to enable granting/removing user privileges
         for posting on external-linked nets.  Interrogation for
         "linked net privs" takes place during the "CTRL-L V"
         user-validation sequence.  On systems running open login,
         user privileges for external-linked nets will default to the
         same setting as that for the Citadel net.  If you are set up
         (in CTDLCNFG.SYS) to automatically grant Citadel-net privs
         to a new caller then the new caller will ALSO default to
         automatically receive linked-net privs.  (VAQ)
91Jan14  Added "<G>ateway rooms" as a sub-option to the ".<K>nown
         rooms" command-set.  (VAQ)
91Jan14  Partial-name searches added to <CTRL L> <U>ser-profile and
         <CTRL L> <V>alidate-user commands.  (VAQ)
91Jan18  Enabled ".V" [.View Contents of Packed file (filenames only)]
         which causes Citadel to display the contents of user-specified
         packed file (ZIP, ARC, etc.) showing ONLY the filenames of the
         member files.  The <V> command continues to work as in
         prior versions.  (VAQ)
91Jan20  Net nodes can now be flagged as using "front-end" software
         other than Citadel itself.  Sequence is <CTRL L> then N
         then E (edit node) and then choose option F.  You will then
         be prompted as to whether the node uses "front-end" software
         other than Citadel.  Answering with Y will tell your Citadel
         to add delays when calling that node to allow time for the
         "front end" (such as BinkleyTerm, FrontDoor, etc.) to pass
         control to Citadel for the network session.  If you answer
         N, this will tell your Citadel that the node in question does
         not use a "front end" and will make call-stabilization occur
         much more quickly.  If you answer Y "by mistake" this will NOT
         prevent a normal Citadel-net session from happening.  It will
         only add approximately 5 seconds to the time needed to stabilize
         the call after carrier is detected.  (VAQ)
91Jan20  Added crude dial-out terminal mode via <CTRL L> then D.  Function
		 queries console user for number to dial and number of attempts
         and then drops to "interactive mode" with modem echo flags
         properly set.  Does not currently support anything other than
         dumb-terminal operation.  File-transfer facilities to follow.
         With "not too much work" this may evolve into something.  (VAQ)
91Jan21  Added capability to "shell" to DOS from within chat-mode or
         while using the "dumb terminal" out-dial system (see previous
         note).  Shell to DOS is by CTRL D from console keyboard.  Modem
         is completely ignored inside the shell, making it completely
         secure from user intrusion.  This permits the use of protocol
         drivers (such as DSZ) to handle file-transfers from within
         the dial-out terminal (which is not so "dumb" at this point).  (VAQ)
91Jan31  Began CITANET.EXE which, when finalized, will be a "stand-alone"
         Citadel Networker utility which will be callable "on its own"
         from "front-end" software such as BinkleyTerm and FrontDoor.  (VAQ)
91Feb04  First successful net session using CITANET.EXE -- called from the
         BinkleyTerm batch file by an incoming Citadel net call.  (VAQ)
91Feb08  Cosmetic modification to the Goto command - will now show
         ".goto room: " on a ".g" and will put room-name in quotes
         on an ordinary "g" command.  Pure fluff from Citadel/UX.
         Similar modifications made for <B>ackup commands.  (VAQ)
91Feb11  Citadel will now keep track of the last date on which a user
         has called the system, and will display this to the user at
         login.  This depends on the existence of LOGDATES.SYS in the
         Citadel "home area" directory.  A utility (GENDATES.EXE) has
         been created for the purpose of creating this file.  If the
         file is missing then Citadel just keeps right on going as
         usual.  (VAQ)
91Feb12  Citadel will now keep track of the number of times each user
         has called the system and will display this to the user at
         login.  This depends on the existence of LOGCALLS.SYS for its
         functionality.  GENDATES.EXE has been modified to automatically
         create, and correctly "seed" LOGCALLS.SYS.  If LOGCALLS.SYS is
         missing (or for any other reason inaccessible) then Citadel
         will just keep chugging.  (VAQ)
