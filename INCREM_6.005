93Mar15  Version 6.04 released.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
93Mar14  Work begun on V6.05.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
93Mar15  User Biography code reworked and activated.  Command ".u"
         allows online user to type name of a user and if a biography
		 file is found, Citadel shows it to the online caller.  Pressing
         a "?" will show a list of users having biographies on file.
         Required external utility is USERBIO.EXE which belongs in your
         Citadel "Home-Area" directory.  The biography system is
         completely self-maintaining.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Mar19  Citadel will now show the room description to a user whenever
         the number of new messages in the room equals the total number
         of messages in the room.  This will ALWAYS happen the first
         time a user visits a room, and will happen again for those
         rooms where the user is not "keeping up."  (VAQ)
93Mar19  The file HELPOPT.HLP, which contains the text printed when
         a user does a ".Help ?" (presumably a sysop-maintained list
         of *.HLP files in the HELPAREA directory) is no longer needed.
         Now, when a user does a ".Help ?", Citadel will automatically
         scan the HELPAREA directory and print the name of each helpfile,
         truncating the ".HLP" from the file name, and will present the
         list to the user in a nice columnized format.  (VAQ)
93Mar21  Pressing "@" at any room prompt will give the user a report of
         port-assignment and session time.  This may be quite temporary
         depending on whether it gets utilized by callers.  (VAQ)
93Mar25  At startup, Citadel will search for a file called FASTNET.SYS
         which, if needed, should contain the #CALLOUTPREFIX that your
         modem MIGHT need to use in order to dial out to network at
         9600bps or higher rate(s).  This is to be used to set up a
         special string to enable/disable protocol-negotiation or
         negotiation progress reporting, or any other high-speed modem
         tweak you may need to do in order to get networking to stabilize
         at high speed.  At Jersey Devil we are using "AT V0 W0 DT", but
         Citadel will use this string as a DEFAULT if FASTNET.SYS is
         missing.  This string REPLACES the #callOutPrefix string in
         the event of network OUTDIALING at 9600bps or higher.  (VAQ)

*MAJOR ADDITION NOTE*
93Mar27  Telnet functions activated for users with "*" access which can
         be set by Sysop (or Aide with system password) using the "V"
         command from the Sysop Commands level.  User hits "*" from
         any room-prompt and gets "network>" prompt.  "V" views available
         dialout nodes, and "t" drops user to "telnet>" prompt, which
         expects user to type node name to dial.  Citadel then uses
         ADDITIONAL COMM PORT to "shuttle" the online user to the foreign
         host in a fully-interactive session mode.

		 Activate this by using "SHUTTLE=MODEM" as a command line argument
         for CTDL.EXE in your RUNBBS.BAT file (or equivalent).  REQUIRES
         that you initialize your FOSSIL for dual-port operation, and we
         RECOMMEND that you lock the baudrate of both ports if using
         a high speed modem on the Shuttle Port.

         Additional Hardware Requirement: Second serial port with modem.
         Citadel will auto-sense the BBS on COM1 or COM2 and will assign
         the "shuttle port" to the opposite COMport (BBS on COM1,
         ShuttlePort on COM2, or vice-versa).  ONLY COM1 and COM2 supported.
         It is strongly recommended that the Shuttle Port modem be no
         faster than the BBS port modem.  Otherwise all sorts of evil and
         unpredictable things may happen to your user.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
93Mar27  Added Telnet functions for the Sysop - via the Sysop Command
         level.  Functionally identical to preceeding note except that
         it uses the BBS PORT modem and NOT the SHUTTLE PORT modem.
         Possibly contains a few lurking flakies, but will be completely
         cleaned up for next release.  (VAQ)
93Mar27  Added "<P>rofile" as an option for those using "pause between
         messages."  If the user selects "P" Citadel will search for
         a user "bio" for the author of the current message, if found
         will show it, if not found, will chug merrily along!  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr03  Version 6.05 released.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)

         Citadel:K2NE Version 6.05 is dedicated with love and best wishes
         for their everlasting happiness to Jessica M. Phelps and
         Steven M. Williams.  (VAQ)
