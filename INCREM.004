88Nov14  Version 4.02 released. (AB, VAQ, BR)
88Nov20  General "code cleaning" to shorten executable file size. (VAQ)
88Nov21  Current date is now displayed on Status-bar except during
         short "special message" functions; e.g. modem-init. (VAQ)
88Nov22  Network start time/date is now displayed on Status-bar
         while system is in networking mode. (VAQ)
88Nov22  Status bar will now report time/date when system checks
         for "need to net" during Anytime-Net window(s),
         even if there is no need to network. (VAQ)
88Nov24  Status of SeeMail variable is now reported to the
         status-bar when system is in idle-mode.  Toggling
         this variable by CTRL-V immediately updates status-bar
         if system is idle, otherwise reports to active Console
         screen but not to online user. (VAQ)
88Nov29  Massive editing of code in CALLLOG.C resulting in
         more concise coding and reduction of about 1K in
         CTDL.EXE filesize. (BR)
88Nov29  First successful test of packet-radio gateway
         via Doors at Morningstar Keep. (BR, VAQ)
88Nov30  When aide-user does ".RS" the system will now say
         "Logged in as Aide, UserName" as in the original
         CP/M version.  Otherwise, it reports only the name. (VAQ)
88Dec01  Call-log now reports when a user "closes" a Doorway. (VAQ)
88Dec03  Modified function putWord() located in MSG.C to columnize
         the output of CALLLOG.SYS when the log file (or backup file)
         is viewed.  Flags and parameters are passed to putWord()
         from logReader() located in AB.C. (VAQ)
88Dec03  Specific "Carrier detected" and "Carrier lost" messages
         sent to CALLLOG.SYS.  This presents exact sequence of
         "detection, login, logout, loss" in the system log file
         which should allow for better monitoring of dropped
         carriers without resorting to cryptic symbols. (VAQ)
88Dec04  Carrier-detect message now handles baudrate. (VAQ)
88Dec04  Room creation and deletion messages are now reported to
         CALLLOG.SYS.  This eliminates the need for these messages
         appearing in Aide>, hence shortly they won't! (VAQ)
88Dec05  "Sysop command request" and "QuickNet request" logged
         to CALLLOG.SYS. (VAQ)
88Dec05  User deletion by remote sysop logged to CALLLOG.SYS. (VAQ)
88Dec06  Code added to support local (console) use of Door utilities. (VAQ)
88Dec08  Doorway access code rewritten and streamlined.  The
         auxiliary program DOOR.EXE is no longer used or needed. (VAQ)
88Dec10  Windowed-Xmodem support removed from the Networker. (VAQ)
88Dec11  Code added to support upkeep of ARCHIVE.LOG file in the
         Citadel "Call Log" directory.  If the sysop wants to
         maintain ARCHIVE.LOG as an ongoing record of system
         activity, then the command-line switch "+archlog" should
         be added to the appropriate line(s) in the batchfile(s)
         used to control the unattended operation of Citadel.
         If space or preference is such that the sysop does not
         want ARCHIVE.LOG to be maintained, then simply leaving
         the "+archlog" switch out will cause the process to be
         ignored.  The ARCHIVE.LOG file is updated whenever any
         function is initiated that deletes the current CALLLOG.SYS
         file.  The ARCHIVE.LOG file can be read by an Aide while
         online by executing the ".AQA" command sequence. (VAQ)
88Dec15  Command-line parameter "+recover" is now needed if the
         "crash/recovery" message is desired in Aide.  This should
         not be used during normal Citadel bootup, but only in
         your batchfile for crash-rebooting. (VAQ)
88Dec16  Added code to support shell to DSZ.COM for YMODEM/batch
         and ZMODEM file downloading, including ARChive file
         support.  Stripped out what is now apparently
         extraneous YMODEM-related code. (VAQ)
88Dec17  Added code to support shell to JMODEM.COM for JMODEM
         file downloading, including ARChive file support. (VAQ)
88Dec17  1-K XMODEM, ZMODEM, and JMODEM support added for file
         uploading.  Code is still flakey for incomplete file uploads
         in that it still reports them to Aide> and the logfile,
         and writes a partial file to disk.  Will have to look into
         this.  Also, uploading user's name is now included in the
         "short file description" that is seen during ".Read Extended"
         directory scans. (VAQ)
88Dec17  Adjusted code that administrates the protocolled uploading
         of room messages (non network) so that the ONLY protocol
         we will support for this is Xmodem.  It is our intention
         to completely strip all non-Xmodem code OUT of the Citadel
         itself and handle it completely via shells.  Xmodem shall
         remain, mostly because it is solid code, and has stood the
         test of time.  Also, we will need it for the C86 networker.
         For non-C86-style netting, we will handle that via Doors. (VAQ)
88Dec21  Restructured the way that Citadel utilizes the console status bar
         to display the following information with a user logged in:
               UserName, Baudrate, Time Logged In,
               Date, Current Time, [flags], Current Room
         This is all contained on the single-line status bar by supressing
         the "Citadel-86 Ver X.yy" message when system is "online" and
         only displaying that info when system is in idle-mode.  Current
         room is displayed as user moves through the system, also when
         current room is affected by Aide functions. (VAQ)
88Dec23  Rewrote portion of code that handles protocolled reading of
         messages.  JMODEM and ZMODEM now supported for message downloading.
         Added code to ARC messages prior to sending them to caller if
         caller so chooses. (BR, VAQ)
88Dec24  Ymodem and WXmodem code stripped out of Citadel.  No longer
         needed. (BR)
88Dec24  Fixed bug in protocol message server.  User can now download
         uncompressed message-stream via protocol-selection. (VAQ)
88Dec27  Added "B" command ["Back-up to..."] in doRegular() to access
         unGoTo().  It will replace the <U>ngoto command, releasing
         "U" for "<U>pload File" option. (VAQ)
88Dec28  Call-log report is now generated when an unlogged caller
         sends mail to the sysop. (VAQ)
88Dec29  <D>ownload and <U>pload commands added for file transfer,
         using default protocol of Xmodem (for now).  Also added
         ".D" to read directory in a directory room. (VAQ)
88Dec30  Protocol-drivers "hooked" to the Citadel message-entry
         routines so that DSZ and JMODEM are now accessible for
         message-uploading.  Process is completely transparent
         to the Citadel command-structure, and users can now
         upload messages using Xmodem, 1-K Xmodem, Jmodem and
         Zmodem. (VAQ)
89Jan01  Status bar now reports current value of DL-Time in
         between calls. (VAQ)
89Jan02  Nasty bug fixed to prevent system hangs on loss of
         carrier in certain vulnerable spots. (VAQ)
89Jan02  ".D" command redefined to duplicate the action of
         ".O" (Open a Door).  Directory reading functions
         are now confined to the standard ".R [D or E]"
         sequence. (VAQ)
