90Dec01  Released V5.14.  (VAQ)
90Dec02  Added code to search for other BBS numbers.
         Command is ".f" and presents user with a menu of
         choices for searching.  Menu is internally generated
         dependant on contents of file NODELIST.DAT which must
         exist in the HomeArea directory in order to activate
         this command.  (VAQ)
90Dec04  Utility NODEDATA.EXE written to generate the file
         NODELIST.DAT through prompt-oriented question/answer
         series.  (VAQ)
90Dec08  Utility NODEPARS.EXE written to modify a general file
         of BBS numbers (line-oriented) and parse the file into
         into a format compatible with Citadel:K2NE's search
         and display algorithm for use with the ".f" command.
90Dec12  Code added to Citadel allowing entering of partial
         name of recipient when sending Mail>.  Citadel will
         search the userbase to find matches, and present each
         match to the user and ask for confirmation after each
         one.  Sends mail to recipient when user answers "Y"
         to the confirmation prompt.  If no match found, or if
         user rejects each match as presented, the user is
         returned to the Mail> prompt after receiving a message
         informing that no match was found.  Not active for
         net message in Mail> since there is no way of checking
         for existence of a user on a "foreign" node.  The search
         string need NOT be at the beginning of the name.  For
         example, if the user enters "ohn" as the person to get
         the mail, the system will show him "John Doe" as well
         as "Joe Johnson" since a match will be found on the
         string "ohn" for either name.  (VAQ)
90Dec12  When using the "lock" or "private" parameters, system
         will now prompt for "Username" and then "Password"
         for login purposes.  This adds a layer of security
         since the username and password must coincide or the
         caller will either be prompted to enter as a new user
         ("lock" active) or dumped ("private" active).  (VAQ)
90Dec14  Code added to support the new ".ecu" command for those
         users who do not want their names to appear in the list
         generated by the "<W>ho ELSE is here" command in Mail>.
         ".enter configuration unlisted username" (.ecu) is a
         toggle and is saved with the rest of the user's configuration
         data.  The ".aqu" command is not affected by this.  (VAQ)
90Dec16  Patched name-search code used in mail> to "short-circuit"
         the username match if mail is to "sysop."  (VAQ)
90Dec20  Created a new class of room - "linked to external net".  When
         a user enters a message in one of these rooms, the message is
         saved to Citadel in the normal way, and also saved to a file
         called ALTERNET.### where ### is the Citadel room number.  User
         is also prompted to enter the name of the Recipient for such
         messages.  This Recipient is NOT saved to Citadel, but is used
         in the external-net message.  (VAQ)
90Dec21  Citadel now creates/maintains two additional files in the
         homeArea directory:  LINKDIRS.SYS and ROOMLINK.SYS.  ROOMLINK
         is a list of rooms that are "external-net linked" along with their
         respective Citadel room numbers.  LINKDIRS.SYS is a list of the
         linked room numbers along with the "external net" disk directory
         associated with each.  For example, Room 40 might be "For Sale"
         and you want it linked to the FIDOnet FOR-SALE conference which
         you are maintaining on your D:\FIDO\FOR-SALE directory.  In the
         file ROOMLINK.SYS, Citadel will place a line which will read
         "040: For Sale" and in the LINKDIRS.SYS file Citadel will place
         a line which will read "040: D:\FIDO\FOR-SALE".  (VAQ)
90Dec23  New command under "Aide Edit-room":  <E>xternal net link enable.
         This tags the room as an "external-net linked room".  You will
         then be asked if you want to link a directory to this room.
         Answering <Y> will result in your being prompted for the directory.
         The FULL PATH should be entered at this point.  This is NOT a
         file-transfer directory, but is the directory where the "external
         net" messages are stored (see note for 90Dec21).  At this point
         Citadel sets the relevant room flags and creates/updates the
         files ROOMLINK.SYS and LINKDIRS.SYS as needed.  (VAQ)
90Dec24  Completed utilities:
            1) SCANDIR.EXE -- checks each FIDOnet directory for highest
               message and creates file CTDLHIGH.DAT in each FIDO directory
               containing the current high-message number.  This MUST be
               run from the directory containing your FIDO-compatible
               AREAS.BBS list.  See your FIDOnet/BinkleyTerm documentation
               for information on creating and using the AREAS.BBS file.
            2) FIDOGET.EXE -- finds messages that arrived via FIDOnet
               since the last time you ran SCANDIR, and imports these
               messages to your Citadel homeArea directory.
            3) ALTERGET.EXE -- processes messages that Citadel has generated
               for inclusion into FIDOnet.  Automatically determines how they
               should be numbered, and moves them into their proper FIDOnet
               directory.  This will probably be renamed FIDOPUT.EXE or
               something like that, since the name ALTERGET does not
               give any true hint as to what this utility does.
90Dec24  Citadel will now recognize the parameter "altlink=NAME" on its
         "run line" in the batch file used to process incoming FIDOnet
         messages.  NAME should be the name you want to appear in the
         Citadel message-header.  For example, if you use "altlink=FIDOnet"
         then each incoming message will carry "from FIDOnet" in its
         Citadel message-header.  When you call "CTDL altlink=FIDOnet"
         Citadel will come up, immediately look for messages to process,
         process them if it finds them (automatically placing them into
         the correct room) and then come down again.  Citadel "knows"
         the correct room because each incoming message as its "directory
         of origin" attached to it, and Citadel already knows (from
         LINKDIRS.SYS) which directory corresponds to which Citadel room.
90Dec25  Citadel code adjusted so that you can tag an external-net
         linked room to pass FIDO messages along into the Citadel-net.
         Naturally this assumes that the Citadel room is a shared room.
         You will be prompted for this during the Aide-Edit_Room External
         process (see note for 90Dec23 for more information on the "ae"
         sequence and other commands/prompts that affect external-net
		 linking and directories).  Citadel will not pass messages into
         FIDOnet from other Citadel nodes.  To do this would be a
         violation of current FIDOnet policy.  The code to do this is
         already written but has been pulled from the executable release
         and also from the source files until/unless FIDOnet policy
         changes.  (VAQ)
90Dec27  Cured a nasty bug in the FIDOnet message importing routines
         that caused FIDO messages destined for INVITATION ONLY rooms to
         flop into the BaseRoom (Lobby here).  (VAQ)
90Dec27  First successful two-way exchange from Citadel to/from FIDOnet.
         This stuff actually DOES work!  (VAQ)
90Dec29  Corrected bug that caused a system crash if BADUSERS.SYS did not
         exist and a new person logged in.  (VAQ)
91Jan02  CITAGATE.EXE written to combine the SCANDIR, ALTERGET and FIDOGET
         utilities mentioned on 90Dec24 into one all-purpose utility.
         CITAGATE.EXE contains its own documentation file (CITAGATE.DOC)
         to which you are referred for complete instructions.  (VAQ)
91Jan03  Corrected bug in Citadel that caused a system "hang" for
         certain obscure conditions on first caller of a new day.  (VAQ)
91Jan05  Patched Citadel for much quicker session layer during import
         of external net messages (when param ALTLINK= invoked).
         All the usual banner, information and modem-handling
         activity is skipped so that Citadel can get right to
         the task of processing incoming messages.  (VAQ)
91Jan07  Added the "!" symbol as an identifier for external-net linked
         rooms during a room display.  (VAQ)
91Jan12  Version 5.15 released.  (VAQ)
