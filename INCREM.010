90Mar02  Remote-sysop new-user-validation code now prompts for settings
         of switches for Download, Door and Net privileges while
         validating a new user when LOGINOK is set to 0 and the
         LOCK or SECURE parameters are not in use.  (VAQ)
90Mar03  Optional file VALRULES.BLB is displayed to first-time caller
         just prior to disconnect when LOGINOK is set to 0 and the
         LOCK or SECURE parameters are not used.  (VAQ)
90Mar04  Added support for up to 25 "logtext" files to be shown to
         a user immediately after login, expanding the prior capability
         in this area.  Filenames are LOGTEXT.000 through LOGTEXT.024
         inclusive, and they must be in the HelpArea directory.  Colors
         alternate between the variables in the second and third positions
         of the "coltb=a,b,c,d,e" parameter for those users having their
         ANSI switch toggled active.  (VAQ)
90Mar12  Minor bug fixes patched - public release files updated.  (VAQ)
90Mar22  Code which generates PcBoard.Sys, DorInfo1.Def and Altern.Def
         has been REMOVED from CTDL.EXE.  (VAQ)
90Mar22  *** IMPORTANT FOR SYSTEMS RUNNING "DOORS" ***
         A new utility, CTDLKEY.EXE, has been created which processes
         information passed to it from Citadel.  This utility MUST be
         in your \DOOR subdirectory (\HomeArea\DOOR to be precise).
         CTDLKEY.EXE is called AUTOMATICALLY when a user exits to
         run a door, and will process information from a file
         generated by Citadel prior to exiting for Door use.
         It will then create PcBoard.Sys, DorInfo1.Def and Altern.Def
         and will place these files in the same directory.  The ONLY
         CHANGE you have to make to your Door batch files is to make
         sure you put a copy of CTDLKEY.EXE in your \HomeArea\DOOR
         subdirectory so that it is available for system use!
         NOTE WELL:  Citadel:K2NE V5.10 WILL NOT RUN DOORS UNLESS
                     YOU MAKE THESE CHANGES!!!!!  (VAQ)
90Mar23  CTDLKEY.EXE modified to generate DOORLOG.SYS in the
         \HomeArea\Door directory each time a user exits to a Door.
         This is a self-appending file which requires sysop management
         or else it will grow without limit.  Also, if DOORLOG.SYS
         is moved to the \HomeArea\System directory, it will be available
         for display using the new AIDE command ".AQD" (Aide Query DoorLog).
         This can easily be done by having each of your ?.BAT Door Control
         batchfiles copy DOORLOG.SYS to the \HomeArea\System directory
         at the end of each Door session prior to returning to the BBS.
         On a regular basis, you can also rename DOORLOG.SYS to DOORLOG.BAK
         in the \HomeArea\System directory, which will then make the ".BAK"
         file available for the other new AIDE command ".AQBD" (query
         backup DoorLog).  If you do this, you MUST DELETE the existing
         copy of DOORLOG.SYS in your \HomeArea\DOOR subdirectory, or the
         old log will simply be copied over to the system area the next
         time a user accesses a Door.  This is a lot easier to DO than it
         is to read about!  A batchfile, run weekly for example, can handle
         this automatically.  (VAQ)
90Mar24  Added code to support new Aide commands ".AQD" and ".AQBD".  For
         details, see previous note.  (VAQ)
90Mar29  Version 5.10 released to beta-test sites.  (VAQ)
90Apr01  DOORSTAT.EXE created - this utility parses DOORLOG.SYS (in the
         DOOR subdirectory) to create DOORSTAT.SYS, which is a brief
         summary of Door usage.  (VAQ)
90Apr07  Citadel:K2NE V5.10 released.  (VAQ)
