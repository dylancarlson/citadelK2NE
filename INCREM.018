91Apr28  Released Version 5.17.  (VAQ)
91May11  Parameter NOAQ no longer supported.  (VAQ)
91May13  If logged user has SCREENLENGTH and PAUSE set and if
         current message triggers the "-More-" prompt, Citadel
         will clear the console screen prior to displaying
         the next message.  We try this on the Sysops before
         we send it out the modem and foist it onto the users!  (VAQ)
91May13  CTDL.EXE Command-line parameters LOGTRY and ANSI are no longer valid.
         These are now in CTDLCNFG.SYS, with #LOGTRY <integer> and
         #ANSICONSOLE <0 or 1> taking their place.  #LOGTRY <integer>
         specifies the number of bad login tries a caller will be
         allowed before Citadel hangs up the phone.  #ANSICONSOLE
         takes a value of 0 (false) or 1 (true) and determines whether
         the local console displays using ANSI colors or "old style"
         colors (still as a command line parameter).  (VAQ)
91May13  CONFG.EXE updated to reflect new variables in CTDLCNFG.SYS
         and set at Version 10.1.  Release of Citadel:K2NE V5.18
         will REQUIRE the use of the new configurator, and to run
         CONFG N using the new CONFG.EXE configurator prior to
         using the new CTDL.EXE code or evil things will happen!  (VAQ)
91May13  Citadel UTILITIES updated to reflect new CTDLTABL that
         is generated by the new CONFG program.  Old utilities will
         not work with V5.18 or newer.  (VAQ)
91May14  CTDL.EXE command-line parameter "+SLOW" is no longer valid.
         There is a new variable in CTDLCNFG.SYS, namely #MODEMSPEED,
         which behaves as follows:
            1) #MODEMSPEED 0
               Use this if your modem is not fast enough to take a
               "raw dump" of the init strings from the computer.
            2) #MODEMSPEED 1
               Use this if your modem CAN take a "raw dump" of the
               init strings from the computer.
         Past experience has shown that most "Hayes compatible"
         modems can take the init-strings at "full speed" and hence,
         #MODEMSPEED 1 appears to be the best choice in most cases.
         However, notably, the "real" Hayes modems CAN'T do this!
91May14  CTDL.EXE command-line parameter "+NETLOG" is no longer valid.
         This has also been placed into CTDLCNFG.SYS as the variable
         #NETLOG.  Permissable values are 0 or 1.  If you want your
         system to create and keep a log of your network sessions,
         use #NETLOG 1 otherwise use #NETLOG 0 and no network log
         will be generated.  You should remove this (and the other
         previously mentioned) parameters from any line in your
         main BBS batch-file that calls CTDL.EXE into action.
         NOTE - CONFG.EXE is updated for these changes, as are
         the utility programs.  (VAQ)
91May15  CTDL.EXE command-line paramater "+NOCHATATALL" is no longer
         valid and has been replaced by #NEVERCHAT in CTDLCNFG.SYS,
         with #NEVERCHAT 0 indicating anyone may page the sysop for
         chat, and #NEVERCHAT 1 indicating that only remote sysops
         can page for chat (which presumes that they first have used
         the remote password).  (VAQ)
91May16  CTDL.EXE command-line parameter "+NODOORS" is no longer
         valid and has been replaced by #NEWDOORPRIVS in CTDLCNFG.SYS.
         Use #NEWDOORPRIVS 1 if you want a new user to automatically
         have door privileges, and #NEWDOORPRIVS 0 otherwise.  If you
         are running your system under any of the "closed" or "restricted
         access" options then this really doesn't matter since your
         CTRL-L V sequence for user validation will prompt for door
         privileges and set the user's account according to your response
         at the time you validate the user.  (VAQ)
91May18  CTDL.EXE command-line parameter "short=<integer>" is no longer
         valid and has been replaced by #SESSIONTIMELIMIT in CTDLCNFG.SYS.
         This will eventually be supplanted by the ability to define
         session time-limits through the use of #EVENT lines so that
         the sysop can make this a time (or day) dependent variable.
         If you want to run your system without any session limits,
         you can use #SESSIONTIMELIMIT 0 or you can simply omit the
         line entirely.  Otherwise, the number you use as your setting
         for #SESSIONTIMELIMIT will govern the time a user will be
         permitted online (per call) in minutes.  (VAQ)
91May25  Modified the output format of NODELIST.EXE to produce output
         which is compatible with TOPOL.EXE, a product of Hue, Jr.
         of Minneapolis MN.  Direct the output of NODELIST.EXE to
         a filename of your choice and then use the resulting file
         in conjunction with TOPOL.EXE to perform network analysis.  (VAQ)
91May26  Citadel will now place a message in your Aide room whenever
         a new user first calls your system.  Thanks to Mike Cottle
         for this suggestion!  (VAQ)
