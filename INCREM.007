89Oct26  Removed "linkprivs" as a command-line option since it is now
         totally un-needed in light of "nodoors" and other door flag
         enhancements - see revisions for 89Oct24/25/26 contained
         in INCREM.006 file.  (VAQ)
89Oct26  "+netdebug" parameter support removed from public executable
         code version.  (VAQ)
89Oct26  Added "Pause" after messages as user configuration option,
         and ".ECP" command to support it via a flag-bit set in the
         user's account record (defaults to OFF for new users).  (VAQ)
89Oct27  Added code to support verbose message headers as per user
         configuration in ctdllog.sys - added configuration dialogue
         for user to set this in his account.  Defaults to short
         message headers for new users.  (VAQ)
<><><><><><><> Code Released as Version 5.04 at this point. <><><><><><>
>>>>> Version 5.05 modifications start here <<<<<
89Nov04  Citadel will now pass user's ANSI status to PCBOARD.SYS file
         which is generated whenever a user goes to a Door.  At this
         time, little point is seen in passing this flag to DORINFO#.DEF
         since the user can set his ANSI level via MONITOR, which will
         "remember" it for each user.  (VAQ)
89Nov04  Code added to handle certain modems which chop off banners
         at login when caller is not at 2400bps.  Solves the problem
         of the Everex 2400bps internal modem.  (VAQ)
<><><><><><><> Code Released as Version 5.05 at this point. <><><><><><>
>>>>> Version 5.06 modifications start here <<<<<
89Nov07  Added command-line param "noaq" to disable the ".AQx" command
         sequences for those sysops who don't want prying eyes of their
         Aides into caller and network log files.  Aide at sysConsole
         can still use those commands!  (VAQ)
89Nov08  Added code that will (hopefully!) permit Citadel to be run
         as a "door".  Theoretically, this should permit someone
         running RBBS or some other system to run a Citadel BBS as an
         application program ("door-ware").  Since this necessitates
         special treatment of the modem at logon and logoff, we have
         to "tell" Citadel that it is a "door" when we boot it.  To
         do this, use the command-line parameter "asdoor" when calling
         Citadel in the batch file controlling it when run as a door.
         Citadel will try to type the file "citdoor.blb" to the user
		 when it first comes up "as a door", so if there is something
		 special you want to tell the user at this point, put it in
		 that file.  When the user logs out of the "doorCit", it will
		 exit with errorlevel = 0.  (VAQ)
89Nov12  Code added to support new mode of login.  For lack of better
         terms, call it "Secure".  When parameter LOCK is used in
         conjunction with CTDL.EXE, the system will type out the usual
         introductory stuff and immediately bring the caller to the
         login area.  If the caller is new (just presses ENTER for
         a password) then he is immediately brought to "enter mail
         to the sysop" without going through the motions of
         getting to the mail> room.  System disconnects on
         message-save or abort.  Bad password tries are immediately
         disconnected.

         >>>> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!  It will be completely debugged
         >>>> in a future release.  (VAQ)
89Nov15  Added code to permit Citadel to run under a "front end" program
         such as BinkleyTerm.  In this case, Citadel networking cannot
         as of now be supported.  There may also be other niggling problems
         that remain to be tested.  To run Citadel with BinkleyTerm
         or similar front-end-mailers, use BINK as a parameter when
         running CTDL.EXE.  (VAQ)
89Nov23  Added code to support ".Aide Query Remote-FIDOnet-Log" (.AQR) and
         ".Aide Query Local-FIDOnet-Log" commands.  If you are running FIDO
         or RBBS net software as a Door, you may opt to have your console
         logfile copied to your SYS area and rename it to FIDOCONS.LOG.
         Similarly, copy your modem logfile to the same area and rename it to
         FIDOCOM1.LOG (the "COM1" part of the filename has absolutely nothing
         to do with the COMport you are using - I just needed a name!).  This
         should be done as part of your FIDO or RBBSnet door batchfiles since
         Citadel is oblivious to that stuff and will only type the files to
         the logged in user if they are where Citadel expects them to be, and
         if they are named correctly.  (VAQ)
89Nov24  Tightened code supporting several of the ".A" commands.  (VAQ)
89Nov24  Parameters COLOR= and STATUS= are no longer supported.  In their
         place, use COLOR=xx,yy where xx is the Screen/Background color
         desired, and yy is the StatusLine color desired.  For example,
         if you have been using "COLOR=66" and "STATUS=31" in your BBS
         batchfile when calling CTDL.EXE, you will now use "COLOR=66,31".
         No spaces and (obviously, I hope) no quotes.  The reason for
         this change was to eliminate one possible command line parameter
         by combining two related parameters.  Experimentation with the
         color/digit codes is in order here to find what appeals to
         you, and what looks best on your monitor, since not all display
         cards and monitors are created equally!  (VAQ)
89Nov25  Added code to read FIDOnet remote and local backup logs.  Using
         ".AQBR" and ".AQBL", Citadel will type out FIDOCOM1.BAK and
         FIDOCONS.BAK respectively.  It is left to the Sysop to cause these
         files to be generated on a daily/weekly/monthly basis, as desired,
         and placed in the same directory as the FIDOCOM1.LOG and FIDOCONS.LOG
         files.  This can easily be handled by the BINKLEY.BAT and
         BINKLEY.EVT files which most folks accessing FIDOnet or RBBSnet
         will be using anyway.  (VAQ)
89Nov27  Added ability to send message to an online user.  This is invoked
         via function key F10.  Message is contained in file CHATCALL.BLB
         and may, of course, say anything the sysop desires.  If file is not
         present, default message is "The Sysop requests a chat."  (VAQ)
89Dec02  Cleaned up some minor code in the interface handling Citadel
         and BinkleyTerm.  (VAQ)
89Dec10  Modified code used to read the table-of-contents ("TOC") of
         archived files so that the ".RC" command will now handle files
         of type LZH, ARC, PAK and ZIP.  Beginning with distribution of
         this version (5.06), sysops MUST use the new "TOC_READ.COM"
         utility which accompanies this release.  It must be in the same
         directory where "IFL.COM" formerly resided.  In keeping with this
         change, the command sequence ".RHD", which formerly handled the
         special case of LZH file content reading, is gone.  (VAQ)
