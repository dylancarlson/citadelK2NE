89Jan07  Patched the "<D>ownload a File" command to accept user-
         selected protocols via self-generating list of active
         protocol options.  Created separate function to handle
         the protocol-list generation and selection.  Created
         new function to handle "<U>pload a File" command and
         'hooked' it into the protocol-selection function. (VAQ)
89Jan08  Added code to "blink" the contents of the status bar
         if the user does a <C>hat request.  Blink shuts off
         on user termination, loss of carrier, or sysop response
         to the chat request, whichever occurs first. (VAQ)
89Jan09  Added code to send NOTICE40.BLB to user at login if
         user screen-width  is set to 40col or less, otherwise
         to send NOTICE.BLB.  In either case, file is only sent
         if it exists.  Kudos to Tom Mailloux for this idea! (VAQ)
89Jan15  The USER option for message-reading has been adjusted
         to allow callers to SKIP messages by specified user as
         well as to read ONLY messages by specified user. (VAQ)
89Jan16  Code added to the Doors handler to generate file ALTERN.DEF
         for use by TradeWars-1000 as a door application.  This
         includes proper flagging of Citadel to properly handle
         logoff after a user runs the TradeWars door.  If used,
         the TradeWars door MUST be door "T" and may require
         a LOT of fiddling in order to get it to run properly.
         Citadel:K2NE now RESERVES exit-level EIGHT (8) for
         use with TradeWars, so do NOT use "IF ERRORLEVEL 8"
         in your BBS batchfiles and do NOT use "8" as an exit-level
         for any #event in your CTDLCNFG.SYS file. (VAQ)
89Jan19  Added code in LOG.C to support reading a file called
         DAYNOTES.BLB immediately after NOTICE.BLB.  As usual,
         if the file is not there, the operation is simply skipped.
         If DAYNOTES.BLB is to be used, it should go where the
         .HLP and .BLB files are located. (VAQ)
89Jan19  Added code in LOG.C to support shelling to a batchfile
         called LOGGED.BAT immediately after Citadel acknowledges
         user login.  This provides for a "run at login" Door
         application, or use of an external program to generate
         a timely file for use as DAYNOTES.BLB provided external
         support for proper file/directory manipulation is provided
         via the LOGGED.BAT file.  If LOGGED.BAT does not exist in the
         "Home" directory this entire operation is skipped. (VAQ)
89Jan21  Rewrote external-protocol handler calls in AB.C to enable
         local modification so that individual sysops can use any
         external protocol driver they wish instead of being
         "forced" to a particular driver.  File XFERCTL acts as
         a "script interface" between Citadel and the external
         protocol drivers to enable local command-line modifications
         and any special "bells and whistles" the sysop may want.
         Citadel passes protocol, baudrate, and logged username
         to the handler interface for those drivers needing this
         information. (VAQ)
89Jan22  Modified CTDL.C and AB.C to re-enable the Windowed Xmodem
         protocol.  (VAQ)
89Jan28  Added code to execute, if present, NEWUSER.BAT at new user
         login to enable sysops to install a "new user" door.  This
         permits such things as "forcing" a new user into a Questionaire
         door.  If system is running with LOGINOK set to 0 (closed)
         then it will skip this routine entirely.  If NEWUSER.BAT
         is not present, routine is skipped even for open
         login systems. (VAQ)
89Jan31  Added code to write LASTUSER.SYS to homeArea directory at
         system shutdown.  This file contains the name of the last
         logged-in user on the system.  At system bootup, LASTUSER.SYS
         is read and the last user's name passed to Citadel for use
         in the status bar and the ".RS" command. (VAQ)
89Feb01  System will now display POLICY.HLP to a new user immediately
         after the new user exits the NEWUSER.BAT execution area, or
         immediately after the new user completes the config questions
         in the absence of NEWUSER.BAT.  The "Type .Help POLICY" message
         is no longer displayed. (VAQ)
89Feb04  Modified output format of the ".RE" command. (VAQ)
89Feb06  Adjusted ".RE" format to adjust indentation depending on
         user screen-width. (VAQ)
89Feb09  Eliminated bug which would cause system to go "brain dead"
         on lost carrier during message entry. (VAQ)
89Feb11  Minor changes to the network log messages format. (VAQ)
89Feb12  Released V4.05 with upload to GEnie. (VAQ)
