  *  Hopefully, we will keep this file, and its successors, reasonably

  *  "K2NE Dialect" of Citadel-86.

   The following features were added to the code as received from the
   C-86 Test System BBS.  The parent code to V3.09.07:K2NE originally
   was Citadel-86 V3.05, then V3.09 upon the addition of Anytime Network
   by Hue, Jr. of the Twin Cities (MN) area, without whose untiring effort
   Citadel-86 simply would not exist!

   This list is current as of August 15, 1988.

   1. Addition of the "+seemail" command-line option which has the effect
	  of making what a user does while in Mail> visible.  This was the
	  original intent.  The byproduct of this code was that it also made
	  what a user does in an Anonymous room visible to an observer seated
	  at the system console.

   2. Addition of the "+" and "-" key commands at any room prompt which
	  allows the user to move between rooms.  If the user is NOT in floor
	  mode, then the effect of these keys is system-wide with the EXCEPTION
	  of the Mail> room, which these keys bypass.  If the user IS in floor
	  mode, then + and - only allow for movement between rooms on the CURRENT
	  floor.  Leaving a room by using + or - does NOT set the messages in the
	  room as "old".  Future revisions may change this, however, as it seems
	  to have introduced a bit of user-confusion.

   3. Use of the ">" and "<" keys to move between floors.  This only works
	  if the user is in FLOOR mode.

   4. The "style" of the messages reported to the CALLLOG.SYS file was
	  completely revamped, making them (hopefully) more readable and less
	  cryptic.  In addition, the following user-activities are now reported
	  to the CALLLOG file:
		  a) chat requests if chat is not activated
		  b) user uploading/downloading (protocol transfers only - no reports
			 for such things as textfile reading, archive directory reading
			 and such).
		  c) Network sessions
		  d) System ups and downs
		  e) Backup of the CALLLOG file (see note on this later)

   5. The "style" of the NETLOG.SYS file was extensively modified in order
	  to reflect the layered-approach to networking which seems to be in
	  vogue these days thanks to the ISO.  In addition, certain new
      NETLOG reports were introduced along with FlashMail! and the
	  addition of the Net_Switch series of operations.

   6. New AIDE commands:
		  a) .AQS  Aide: Query System-log
		     This allows an aide to read CALLLOG.SYS from any room.
		  b) .AQN  Aide: Query Network-log
			 This allows an aide to read NETLOG.SYS from any room.
		  c) .AQBS Aide: Query Backup System-log
		  d) .AQBN Aide: Query Backup Network-log
		  e) .AQU  Aide: Query UserBase
			 This displays a very comprehensive list of all system
			 accounts, together with most of the configuration options
			 selected by each user.  Also shows which users know which
			 rooms, which have long-distance net credits, and such.

   7. New Remote-sysop (and CTRL-L) functions
		  a) .ADE  Aide: Delete Empty-rooms
		  b) .ADS  Aide: Delete System-log(*)   *These commands cause a .BAK
		  c) .ADN  Aide: Delete Network-log(*)    file to be generated.
          d) CTRL-L <G>: (General Maintenance Menu)
				 <S>  System log review
				 <N>  Network log review
				 <B>  Backup log files
			 The reason we did this was so that the system log, net log,
			 and log backups could be done from console without logging in.

   8. FlashMail! routines
		 This enables system-to-system mail forwarding through the
		 .ECA user profile (configuration) option.  Previously, mail
		 forwarded by this option would stop at the system where
		 it was sent, even if the recipient on that system had
		 his forwarding address set to another system.  This is
		 no longer the case.  Multiple node mail forwarding is
		 now enabled via this method.  In addition, as a piece of
		 mail "makes its way" from node to node to its recipient,
		 the return mailpath is attached to the message so that
		 if the recipient elects to respond to the mail, the response
		 will "know" how to get back to the original sender.  Appropriate
		 safeguards are in the code to eliminate "infinite loops" and
		 other nastiness.

   9. Net_Switch routines
		 Sysop-definable mail PATHways.  See the narrative file
		 READ.ME which accompanies the release of V3.09.07 for
		 an in-depth treatment of this topic.  The reason for
		 this approach was the eminent distaste Alan and I have
		 for Unix-style pathing.  We wanted to make this as
		 invisible to the user as possible.  We think that we
		 succeeded.  Nodes for which a Path is defined will appear
		 in the list of nodes that the user is shown when pressing
		 "?" after being prompted for the "system to send to"
		 when entering network mail messages.  The user has no
		 way of knowing which nodes are directly netted and
		 which nodes are via pathways, nor should the user
		 care since the effect (as far as the user can see)
		 is identical.  Again, return paths are built up as the
		 message makes its way to its destination so that reply
		 paths are inherent.  In both FlashMail! and Net_Switch,
		 a mail message will STOP as soon as it finds its recipient
		 on a system in the path.  If the recipient has his forwarding
		 address set, FlashMail! will then supercede Net_Switch from
		 that point to the ultimate destination node.
