91May27  Released Version 5.18.  (VAQ)
91Jun13  Added code to support ".U" and ".EU".
           .U: User-information -- Citadel will prompt for the user
           name, and then will search for an "information file" that
           the user may have posted.  If present, the file is typed
           to the logged-in user.
           .EU: Enter user information -- Allows a user to enter
           a comment about him/herself.  Full Citadel editor is
           available for comment entry, and size is limited by
           maximum message size in CTDL.H module.  If such
           a file already exists, the user will be shown the current
           file and asked if it is to be changed.  (VAQ)
91Jun15  Added code to support ".W" for logged-in users.
         ".Who's on file" will search for those users who have left
         information files via ".EU".  Citadel will then display this
         name-list to the user in a column-formatted manner dependant
         on the terminal-screen-width of the user.  (VAQ)
91Jun30  "The final word" on the ".EU", ".U" and ".W" commands:
          1) ".U" will prompt the user to enter the name of a
            person whose information file is to be displayed.
            The user can enter ? for the name in order to see
            a list of users who have information on file.
            Pressing ENTER or ESC will abort from this.
          2) ".W" will display the list of users who have
            entered informational files.
          3) ".EU" will show the current user his/her own information
            file (if it exists) and ask if he/she wants to change it.
            If a change is desired, the user is dumped into the editor
            to create a new information file.  If the user has not yet
            created an information file, then the user will be dumped
            into the editor without being shown what doesn't yet exist! (VAQ)
