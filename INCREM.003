88Oct03  Released Ver 4.01 (AB, VAQ, BR)
88Oct06  Begin Ver 4.02 (AB, VAQ, BR)
88Oct06  Minor cosmetic change to display printed during ".AB". (VAQ)
88Oct09  Added "... [last 20 char in msgBuf.mbtext]" to the
         <C>ontinue option in the Entry Cmd section.  Retrofitted
         this modification to Version 4.01 already released. (VAQ)
88Oct10  Added code to display member-net numbers when net-roster
         is called using CTRL-L/N/V sequence.  Change "<need to call>"
         to "Work pending" to shorten line-space.  Retrofitted
         to Version 4.01 already released. (VAQ)
88Oct14  "M" command section changed to show ".M" as an error rather
         than having the extended-command duplicate the "M"
         command (in case we want it for later). (VAQ)
88Oct14  "-clock" command-line paramater disabled via #ifdef HUE_STYLE
         to shorten executable code since most folks want the
         clock in their stat bars. (VAQ)
88Oct14  Added CTRL K as "twit" key.  Pressing CTRL K with user online
         will cause Citadel to act as if user dropped carrier at
         next available room-prompt.  Acts immediately if user is
         at a room prompt, otherwise waits for completion of current
         user activity then dumps him. (VAQ)
88Oct14  Removed ESC CTRL-L Q sequence for QuickNet.  Replaced with
         CTRL-Q which triggers QuickNet ONLY while system is IDLE.
         No longer required to use ESC to go to the 'console mode'
         in order to trigger the QuickNet function.  Moved the
         QuickNet function code into AB.C. (VAQ)
88Oct15  Twit-key will now look for TWITKEY.BLB and print it, if present,
         to console/modem before pulling DTR - for sysop message to
         user, simulated line-noise or other nasties. (VAQ)
88Oct15  Modification [ROOMB.C] installed so that Aide messages which
         report room editing activities are NOT generated when the
         room editing occurs at the Console.  Room editing which
         is done via modem, even as Remote Sysop, is still reported. (VAQ)
88Oct15  Cleaned up loose-ends in the QuickNet routines. (VAQ)
88Oct15  ".M" created [Mail Network NodeList] as part of the command
         sequence in doRegular().  It displays the list of active
         network nodes (including NETPATH.SYS if it exists). (VAQ)
88Oct16  Modified ABDOOR.C to create file DORINFO1.DEF when user
         enters a Door.  This file contains current and previous
         callers' names in a fashion that is (hopefully) compatible
         with RBBS and PCBoard Door utilities.  Tested and working
         (sort of) with CAVE.EXE at Jersey Devil. (VAQ)
88Oct17  Cleaned up some sloppy Door coding. (VAQ)
88Oct17  Added CTRL-B option to do logfile backups if the system
         is idle.  Code is in MODEM.C. (VAQ)
88Oct18  Removed apparently redundant call to modemInit() in function
         initCitadel() [ROOMA.C] which speeds up load-time. (VAQ)
88Oct22  Added CTRL-V to toggle Mail> status (Privacy vs. Visible)
         at any time while system is idle.  Possibly, we will now
         remove the +SEEMAIL param. (VAQ)
88Oct22  Added CTRL-O to show network nodelist while idle. (VAQ)
88Oct23  Added "doConsoleHelp" which displays FKEYS.BLB when
         system goes idle between callers, after netting,
         and after some console control functions.  If FKEYS.BLB
         is not present, function does nothing. (VAQ)
88Oct25  Added CTRL-Y to toggle ChatMode on/off at any time.
         Online user sees nothing.  Message appears on console screen
         as well as 'C' in status bar if chat is on.  Also, added
         status of Chat to the ".RS" report. (VAQ)
88Oct29  Patched ABDOOR.C to create PCBOARD.SYS in the \DOOR
         subdirectory in a format compatible with PCBoard Doors. (VAQ)
88Oct29  Corrected bug that corrupted format of DORINFO1.DEF if a
         user used more than one door per call. (VAQ)
88Oct29  Added variable to keep track of Door version(s) for
         Citadel-86 development purposes. (VAQ)
88Oct30  Modified ABDOOR.C for folks that use one-word handles.
         Instead of appending "\nLogged-in" to their handle, we now
         append "\n" and repeat their handle as their surname.  This
         is only passed to Door applications via DORINFO1.DEF and
         PCBOARD.SYS and is not used by Citadel itself. (VAQ)
88Nov01  Add code to require console keypress after reading the
         net roster via CTRL O (neat fluff!).  It is my avowed
         intention that we will NOT treat the sysop as a
         "second class citizen."  (VAQ)
88Nov02  Add code for function keys (F1, F2, F3) for log backup,
         QuickNet, and reading the net node list/status while
         the system is idle. (VAQ)
88Nov05  Remove duplicate CTRL-key code for idle-mode functions
         now supported by F1, F2, and F3. (VAQ)
88Nov06  Added code for function key (F4) to directly access all
         network "administrative" commands contained in the
         function "netStuff()" directly from the console via
         single keystroke.  Also added code to display the
         file NETKEYS.BLB if it exists.  Code re-inits the
         modem after execution in case dialing was used. (VAQ)
88Nov07  Added code for <ALT X> to return to MS-DOS directly
         whenever the system is idle.  Creates CTDLTABL.SYS
         on the way to DOS and sets SYSOP_EXIT flag. (VAQ)
88Nov08  Added code to support "?" at idle mode to display
         the FKEYS.BLB file/menu.  Also, if returning to
         'modem' mode from CTRL-L sysop-menu, FKEYS.BLB
         will now be displayed (if it exists and if no
         carrier is present). (VAQ)
88Nov10  Corrected some code in the original netStuff() function
         that made it possible for a remote sysop to cause
         some really pathological happenings.  System now
         checks for carrier during these "sensitive" spots
         and if it finds one, refuses to execute the code
         involved and just bounces the remote sysop back to
         the 'Net fn:' prompt. (VAQ)
88Nov12  Added F6 to enable the sysop to delete a user from
         the "Idle-mode" with a minimum of fuss and bother.
         Also added F7 to go directly to the Sysop command-set
         from the Idle-mode menu.  New menu file to support
         the F7 operation is called OPERATOR.BLB and displays
         only when the sysop command-set is invoked from
         the idle mode. (VAQ)
88Nov14  Version 4.02 released. (AB, VAQ, BR)
