89Dec10  Modified code used to read the table-of-contents ("TOC") of
         archived files so that the ".RC" command will now handle files
         of type LZH, ARC, PAK and ZIP.  Beginning with distribution of
         this version (5.06), sysops MUST use the new "TOC_READ.COM"
         utility which accompanies this release.  It must be in the same
         directory where "IFL.COM" formerly resided.  In keeping with this
         change, the command sequence ".RHD", which formerly handled the
         special case of LZH file content reading, is gone.  (VAQ)
89Dec21  Unlogged caller is now assumed to be using an 80 column terminal.
         While it may have once been valid to allow for 40 column users
         prior to login, most folks are gravitating toward machines that
         use 80 column displays - and besides, once they are logged in
         they can customize this!  SYSOPS TAKE NOTE - you should remove
         the "unlog=xx" parameter from your CTDL batch files.  If you
         don't, then you will get a false "crash message" in your Aide
         room every time you boot Citadel.  (VAQ)
89Dec27  Cleaned up and debugged code for LOCK parameter.  See notes in
         INCREM.007 for complete description of the LOCK parameter.  (VAQ)
89Dec27  Added PRIVATE parameter.  This has all the attributes of the LOCK
         parameter plus if used, when a user presses ENTER to attempt
         to apply for a new account, the system will type
         PRIVATE.BLB (if present) and then drop carrier.  This is for
         those sysops whose circumstance dictates the "ultimate
         siege mode" Citadel.  (VAQ)
89Dec31  Added code to support "Pause/Enter" while reading messages in
         all rooms except Mail>.  If a user pauses the display, then
         presses E to resume, at the end of the current message the user
         will be brought to the message editor.  After either saving or
         holding the message, the user will then resume by re-reading the
         message from which he interrupted the sequence.  During this
         sequence of events, the user's hold-message buffer acts in a
         cumulative way, so that the user can "build up" his replies to
         messages as he goes through the room, "holding" each reply (which
         will be appended to previously held replies) until he is at the
         end of the room, or until he saves the message he has been building.
         In a netted room, the new message will default as a NON-NET message,
         but the user will get the "Save as networked message <Y/N>?"
         prompt which will give him the chance to net the message if he
         so desires.  (VAQ)
89Dec31  Modified Pause/Enter to break current message immediately
         rather than waiting until end.  Also, added code for Pause/REVERSE
         to change direction of message flow while reading.  (VAQ)

90Jan06  Removed ".RC" command and replaced it with "V" (View contents...)
         for reading archived file directories.  Saves keystrokes!  (VAQ)
90Jan06  Tweaked networker for BinkleyTerm compatibility.  (VAQ)
90Jan08  System will check for WARNING.BLB immediately after sending the
         hard-coded message which warns a user that a timed-event will
         occur in five minutes.  If the user is still online when the
         pre-emptive event is scheduled to happen, the system will
         check for SCHEDULE.BLB prior to sending the hard-coded
         disconnect message.  (VAQ)
90Jan11  Total cleanup of code handling LOCK and PRIVATE parameters.
         This should work without problems (finally!).  Also, the
		 use of LOCK or PRIVATE parameters OVER-RIDES the setting
         of the LOGINOK switch in CTDLCNFG.SYS.  However, if you
         have LOGINOK set to 1, a user who logs in WILL be able to
         create a new account by using .Terminate-Stay and then
         logging in as a "new" user.  This could also be done by a
         valid user upon his return from a Door.  If this creates problems
         down the line, it will be changed to force ".TS" (and the
         door-handling functions) to cycle to the secure-login code
         rather than what is presently done.  (VAQ)
90Jan15  Added parameter NETONLY which allows running the BBS in
         network-only mode.  Incoming and outgoing net calls will be
         processed in the usual manner.  Normal callers will be
         disconnected - system will type-out ONLYNET.BLB if it exists.  (VAQ)
90Jan15  New command: ".AN" [.Aide Network-trigger].  Only active for
         Aide-user who knows (and has accessed) the Remote Sysop password.
         Once invoked, Citadel will attempt an "anytime-net" out-dial
         session (if work is pending) as soon as the system has "cycled
         around" after current call termination.  (VAQ)
90Jan17  Code added to support selective downloading from within ZOO archives.
         Command sequence is ".RpC[var]" (.read {protocol} compressed/ZOOfile-
         [files]" which is similar in every way to selective downloading from
         ARC, PAK, ZIP or LHARC file-archives.  Please note:  selective
         downloading using a protocol is restricted to BATCH protocols, which
         is rather dependent on your choice of transfer drivers.  DSZ, for
         example, only handles this cleanly with YmodemBATCH and Zmodem.  This
         is not seen as a tremendous handicap since anyone with the
         sophistication to handle ZOO archives undoubtedly can handle a
         batch protocol!  In order to activate this facility for your
         installation, create a file called UNZOO.SYS containing ONE LINE
         ONLY, and on this line put the name of your "unzoo" utility.  I am
         using OOZ.EXE, which works just fine for me.  Naturally, UNZOO.SYS
         goes in the same directory containing DEARC.SYS, UNZIP.SYS and
         UNLHARC.SYS.  (VAQ)
