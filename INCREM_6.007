93Apr18  Version 6.06 released.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
93Apr18  Added "<D>elete/move" option on prompt which appears after each
         message while reading a room (assuming account is so configured).
         Option is ONLY available (and only appears) if the logged-in
         user is the Sysop, an Aide or the Room Moderator.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr19  Added <F>inger utility to the network> level command-set.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr19  Added "NETWORK.MNU" to show Network> options when user presses "?"
         at the network> prompt while in SubSystem Access.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr24  Added "<S>top [N]ext" prompt while in Mail>.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr25  Citadel will now display the file "REGISTER.BLB" to a new user
         just prior to requesting User Registration Information.  This
         file is NOT REQUIRED and if not present, Citadel will just chug
         right along, however if you want to "warn" your new user that
         he is going to have to provide his address and phone number, this
         is the place to do it - also you can tell your new user that the
         information to be provided can be flagged as PRIVATE and then
         viewable only by the Sysop.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr25  Repaired minor bug in telnet code which would sometimes "trash"
         a long-distance CitaNet session.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Apr26  At startup, Citadel will now read a file called HOSTNAME.SYS
         if it is present.  HOSTNAME.SYS must contain one line only,
         with NO carriage-return at the end of the line.  The file should
         contain your REGISTERED DOMAIN NAME for those of you who are
         "UUCP or Internet-connected."  This is a completely optional
         facility for this version as we build toward the future!  (VAQ, SMW)
93May12  Version 6.07 released.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
