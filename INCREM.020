91Jul03  Released Version 5.19.  (VAQ)
91Jul04  Cosmetic change to the ".W" directory listing.  (VAQ)
91Jul10  Message Editor now shows room-name above "Entry cmd" prompt.  (VAQ)
91Jul11  Message Editor now reports number of characters used and
         number of characters remaining at the "Entry cmd" prompt.  (VAQ)
91Jul14  Streamlined code that handles modem resets.  (VAQ)
91Jul15  Code modified to tighten conditions under which the daily caller
         number is incremented.  Number will only be incremented on
         login after new-carrier or when ".TS" is followed by a login
         and the new login is a different user than the previous login.
         Specifically, if a user goes to a door and then logs in upon
         returning from the door, the caller counter will not increment.
         This will serve as a more accurate guage of system activity.  (VAQ)
91Jul17  Adjusted handling of CTDLTABL.SYS table in anticipation of
         needs for addition of multi-user capability.  Code disabled
         until actual release of multi-user code at a later date.  (VAQ)
91Jul20  Added code to support changing the direction of sequential
         message reading by using "+" or "-" key when user has pause
         feature activated between each message.  Added "<+/->" option
         to the prompt between messages.  (VAQ)
91Jul21  When a user is configured to pause between messages, and if
         the users chooses to <R>eply to a message in a networked
         room, then Citadel would generate a faulty message-header which
         would lead to the originating system sending "bad Netmail" to
         other systems sharing that room.  This bug is fixed.  (VAQ)
