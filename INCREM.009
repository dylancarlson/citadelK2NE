90Jan25  Modification of LOCK parameter to allow caller the chance to
         try his password a second time in the event of a typo - Citadel
         will return to the "Login:" prompt if user answers "n" to the
         "Do you want to apply for an account" question, but only once!  (VAQ)
90Feb03  Modification of status line so that Aide user's name is preceeded
         by an asterisk (*) while logged in.  (VAQ)
90Feb03  Minor adjustment to "front-end aware" section of code to properly
         handle user login when SECURE or LOCK parameters are set and Citadel
         is passed control from a "front-end-mailer."  (VAQ)
90Feb04  ANSI color C-code for users and console screen, written by Alan Bowen
         and patched to main code.  (VAQ)
90Feb05  "+fast" parameter changed to "+slow".  FAST handling of modem
         initialization is now the DEFAULT CASE.  If your modem cannot
         handle high-speed init strings, then use +SLOW to do the
         obvious!  (VAQ)
90Feb05  ANSI colors added as user-config option.  These are tied to the
         user-settable ".ECG" command.  ANSI.SYS is now REQUIRED as a device
         driver, and must appear in your CONFIG.SYS file at bootup.  Consult
         your DOS manual for information on how to do this.  (VAQ)
90Feb05  Parameter "+archlog" no longer supported and the system will now
         maintain ARCHIVE.LOG as the default state.  If you don't want to
         maintain an archive-log, you can simply delete the file ARCHIVE.LOG
         which appears in your log-area, either manually or via batch-file
         automatic maintenance.  (VAQ)
90Feb05  Parameter "ansi" added.  Use this if you have a COLOR monitor
         and if you want ANSI colors displayed on your monitor.  This setting
         will PRE-EMPT the values in your parameter "COLOR=xx,yy", at least
         for this release.  If you use the "ansi" parameter, you should
         discontinue use of "COLOR=xx,yy" as the results are totally
         unpredictable and downright ugly!  (VAQ)
90Feb05  Parameter "+fast" changed to "+slow".  The DEFAULT is to support
         modems that can receive and "digest" command strings at full speed
         from the computer.  If a modem is found not to be able to do this
         reliably, the use of "+slow" in the CTDL.EXE command-line will
         slow down transmission to the modem during "initialization" by a
         factor of approximately 10.  (VAQ)
90Feb09  Param "coltb=a,b,c,d" added to control ANSI color assignment.
         The assignment levels are (roughly) as follows:
             a: message texts, system announcements and major (non-room)
                prompts particularly for nonexpert users, one of the
                introductory (optional logtext.00#) files
             b: the console standby screen (FKEYS.BLB), mail> notification
                at login, display of rooms with new messages, expanded
                descriptions in file directories, message headers, most
                of the help files, room prompts for mail> and aide>,
                known hidden rooms.
             c: HELPOPT.HLP when called by ".h?", terse file directory
                listings, all room prompts except for mail> and aide>,
                list of known directory rooms (.kd), nodes on the net (.m),
                known public rooms, rooms with no new messages.
             d: Known zapped/forgotten rooms.
         The letters (a, b, c, and d) should be replaced with SINGLE DIGIT
         numbers in accordance with the following color-code assignment:
           0=BLACK     1=RED        2=GREEN    3=BROWN
           4=BLUE      5=MAGENTA    6=CYAN     7=WHITE
         These are the ONLY permissable values for this parameter.
         A typical example use of the parameter might be "coltb=2,1,4,5",
         which is, incidentally, the DEFAULT setting if you leave this
         parameter out.  This parameter controls the colors you, as well
         as the modem user, will see (provided you use the "ansi" param
         to activate ANSI color for your console and provided, obviously,
         that the caller has set his ANSI flag ON using the ".ECG" command
         in his user configuration).  (VAQ)
90Feb11  Added additional (5th) color-level to "coltb=" to handle color
         setting for standby screen display (FKEYS.BLB) if present.
         The setting of this variable (digit 0 thru 7) uses the
         8 "dim" or "alternate" color codes.  Experiment here to find
         something that looks good on your monitor!  (VAQ)
90Feb12  Parameter "short=xxx" added.  "xxx" is any integer value (1 to
         three digits) in MINUTES.  This will automatically terminate
         a logged-in session after the desired time-limit has expired.
         Timer starts at login and boots the caller after "xxx" minutes
         have passed, with a warning being sent to the caller when five
         minutes remain in the current session.  Also, time remaining
         for the call in progress is displayed to the caller as part of
         the ".rs" command.  Caller is advised at login if a time limit
         is active.  If param is not used, no limit is active.  (VAQ)
<><><><><><><><> Release of V5.08 at this point [90Feb17] <><><><><><><><><>
90Feb18  Citadel now reports running total of modem-user logins, messages
         posted, network sessions, and number of node-connects successfully
         stabilized (incoming and outgoing).  As the BBS runs, this data
         is periodically written to a file called SYSDATA.USR which will
         be in the Citadel "homeArea" directory (where CTDL.EXE and
         CTDLCNFG.SYS are found).  These counters are also displayed while
         the system is waiting for a call.  If SYSDATA.USR is not present
         when Citadel is started, then it automatically will reset all the
         running totals to zero and start the file for you.  This is
         written to reflect DAILY TOTALS and NOT a "life of the system"
         count.  Thus, for it to make sense to your users you should
         DELETE THIS FILE DAILY, preferrably by use of a #event keyed
         to your main bbs batch file to run at midnight.  Or, see
         the next note concerning CTDLSTAT.EXE.  (VAQ)
90Feb19  CTDLSTAT.EXE written and debugged.  This file digests the data
         contained in SYSDATA.USR and outputs the information in a "human
         readable" form as REPORTER.OUT.  When it is finished, it deletes
         SYSDATA.USR for you so that Citadel can restart the totals.
         All of this automagically happens in the homeArea directory.
         If you are running an "out of the box" Citadel:K2NE, then
         CTDLSTAT.EXE goes in your "C:\K2NE" directory, otherwise, put it
         in the directory containing CTDL.EXE and CTDLCNFG.SYS.  (VAQ)
90Feb20  Call-log entry for login of a modem caller will now show the
         caller number (from SYSDATA.USR's running total - see earlier
         notes on how this file can be handled for daily counts and other
         miscellany).  (VAQ)
90Feb20  Code added to track number of outbound network messages sent to
         other nodes (does not include net mail> messages).  Corresponding
         changes added to CTDLSTAT.EXE also.  (VAQ)
90Feb21  Code added to include current-cycle net session number in the
         net log.  Also, adjusted message counter to include net-forwarded
         mail in the net-message total.  Modified output of CTDLSTAT.EXE
         ("reporter.out") to conform with these adjustments.  (VAQ)
90Feb21  Alternate standby-screen handling for "ansi" parameter added.
         Minor changes in the function-key code (MODEM.C) were patched
         to handle this.  Folks not using ANSI for the local console should
         notice a minimum of change.  ANSI consoles now will display the
         FKEYS.BLB console menu ONLY on pressing "?".  (VAQ)
90Feb23  If the LOCK parameter is not used and if LOGINOK=0, and if
         a caller tries to login as a new user, then Citadel will now
         type out the file APPLY.BLB to the prospective user and then
         drop the new user into the "mail to the sysop" routines.
         After the mail message is completed, Citadel will then guide
         the prospective user through setting up his config options,
         name and password, and will then log him off.  The prospective
         account is then saved to the system BUT is flagged as an
         "un-validated user."  A list of unvalidated users can be
         summoned by an Aide using the new command ".aide: query
         validation pending" (.aqv).  If an aide knows the System
         Password (assuming that the system password has been enabled)
         then the unvalidated user(s) can be validated from the
         Sysop command area using "V" and then answering the
         resulting prompt accordingly (CTRL L, then V, and so forth).
         If an unvalidated user calls back before the account has been
         validated, he will be so informed (optional file NOTYET.BLB
         will be shown if present) and then logged out.  (VAQ)
90Feb25  All statistical counters managed by SYSDATA.USR are now checked
         against current DAY OF MONTH whenever a carrier is detected,
         whenever Citadel is brought UP or DOWN, and whenever the system
         exits (Doors, BinkleyTerm if used, etc.).  If the current DAY
         OF MONTH is different than the one stored in SYSDATA.USR, then
         SYSDATA.USR is copied out to SYSDATA.BAK and all the counters
         are re-set.  You are left to your own inventiveness for handling
         CTDLSTAT.EXE around the change-of-date for making daily reports
         (if you are into that sort of thing).  I recommend that if you
         are going to do that, do it shortly BEFORE midnight and have
         CTDLSTAT process SYSDATA.USR (or a renamed copy of it).  You can
         force the counters to reset by deleting SYSDATA.USR after you
         are done processing it (which may or may not result in flakiness
         later - play with it!) but I don't recommend that approach.  Let
         Citadel handle it - if the bugs aren't too thick, it just
         might work!  (VAQ)
90Feb27  Command "<L>ast 5 msgs" added to type-out last five messages in
         current room to logged in user.  Adjusted MAINOPT.MNU and added
         UNLOGOPT.MNU to reflect changes in the command "L" depending on
         login status of online user.  (VAQ)
90Feb28  Adjusted window code in ANSI console screen during idle-time
         to restore screen faster after pressing "?" to see FKEYS.BLB.  (VAQ)
