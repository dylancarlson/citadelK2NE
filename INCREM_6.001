91Aug16  Released Version 5.20.  (VAQ)
91Aug25  Removed built-in terminal code and manual-dialer options.
         This was done because this feature was suffering from
         general disuse - if folks need a terminal they certainly
         can do better than to use Citadel - plus it saves space!  (VAQ)
91Sep03  Abbreviated display for the ".RS" command.  Removed some
         information that is really superfluous.  (VAQ)
91Oct12  Began work on adding FOSSIL compatibility for all Citadel
         modem I/O routines.  Each Citadel:K2NE sysop will have to
         obtain his/her FOSSIL independently.  According to all
         available documentation, "all FOSSILs are created (essentially)
         equally" so it **shouldn't** matter which one is used.  However,
         this stuff was all tested using X00.SYS (Gwinn FOSSIL driver),
         so I can only "vouch" for that one!  (VAQ)
91Oct17  Work completed on all FOSSIL routines.  Module LIBFOSSL.C
         added to the CN library for CTDL.EXE and CONFG.EXE.
         Function "interpret()" has been removed from Citadel since
         it is now completely superfluous.  The FOSSIL now handles
         ALL modem control and I/O functions.  (VAQ)
91Oct17  Modified Configurator to take #modemSetup and write it out
         to INITLINE.SYS, and modified Citadel to look for INITLINE.SYS
         at boot-time and grab the modem initialization string from it.
         Configurator version bumped to 11.  Citadel:K2NE version
         major-release series bumped to 6.  Beginning with Version 6.01,
         the new (Version 11.1) configurator will be REQUIRED.
         All "mini-interpreter" routines in CTDLCNFG.SYS should be
         either removed or disabled (by indenting a space) except for
         the "#alldone" line.  Configurator (V11.1) will check for
         existence of an active FOSSIL driver and will NOT permit
         Citadel to be configured until a FOSSIL is properly installed.

         NOTE:  The presence of a "#modemSetup" line in CTDLCNFG.SYS is
                absolutely essential.  If it is not there, you still will
                get a "Must have either #modemSetup or #INIT_PORT" note,
                and the configurator will bomb.  DO NOT USE #INIT_PORT.
                Citadel:K2NE now ignores it, will not look for it, and you
                will (subsequently) NOT generate an INITLINE.SYS file
                unless you have a "#modemSetup" specified.  The FOSSIL
                will be properly pointed at the COMport you specify with
                your #COM setting, and your modem will reset between
                calls (and between net calls and net sessions) at the
                baud-rate you specify in #SYSBAUD.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO
                MANUALLY EDIT "INITLINE.SYS" - let the Configurator
                do it for you!

         NOTE:  The stand-alone CITANET.EXE (tm) networker has not yet been
                updated for FOSSIL compliance.  DO NOT attempt to use
                any Version 5.xx CITANET (tm) utility.  The CtdlTabl.Sys
                file used by a V5.xx CitaNet (tm) is NOT compatible with
                the Citadel:K2NE V6.xx CtdlTabl.Sys and hence, older
                CITANET.EXE programs will NOT RUN!  A new CitaNet (tm)
                utility will be released in the near future.  (VAQ)

91Oct20  Added optional configuration variable "#modemReset" for those who
         need a bit more than "AT" sent to the modem as a "prod" after each
         online session.  Syntax (in CTDLCNFG.SYS) is:

         #modemReset "AT etc etc etc etc"

         Assuming a Hayes command-set compatible modem, the string should
         start off with "AT".  What follows can be anything you determine
         that your modem should be "told" in order to reset it.  If this
         parameter is not used in CTDLCNFG.SYS, then Citadel will assume
         a reset-string of "AT" and will send this to your modem immediately
         after dropping DTR at the end of each online session.  This should
         hopefully make sure that your modem resets to your SysBaud value
         in between each use.  (VAQ)
91Oct20  Added optional configuration variable "#DTR-DELAY" for those who
         have modems which need a bit extra time to drop carrier when
         DTR is pulled down.  If your modem seems to be having problems
         resetting at the end of a call or between nodes during networking,
         try adding "#DTR-DELAY n" to your CTDLCNFG.SYS file
         (where n is any integer).  For example, "#DTR-DELAY 1" will add
         about 20 milliseconds to the time the system will wait after pulling
         DTR.  "2" would add about 40 milliseconds, "3" about 60 milliseconds,
         and so forth. (VAQ)
91Oct22  Added routines to handle the RTS flag of the Modem Control
         Register -- this may not be important to all systems under all
         conditions but it is recommended in the FOSSIL standard and won't
         hurt anything.  Thanks to John Luce for the idea and for his
         assistance in writing this code.  (VAQ)
91Oct23  Removed the "User Information" facility.  General feedback has been
         that this feature was vastly ignored.  It took up a lot of code
         space that can be put to other uses.  (VAQ)
91Oct28  Released V6.01  (VAQ)
