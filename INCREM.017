91Feb16  Version 5.16 released.  (VAQ)
91Feb17  Added code to tell user how much download time will be left
         for current session prior to beginning a download.  Rounds down
         to next whole minute value.  (VAQ)
91Feb19  Added code to report session download time-limit at login.
         If user does not have download privs, this display is skipped. (VAQ)
91Mar23  Added code to display local time-of-day to user above each
         room-prompt.  A rather useless thing, but cute.  (VAQ)
91Mar30  Added code to give "<A>gain <S>top <R>eply [N]ext: " after each
         message if logged-in user's account is configured to pause
         after each message.  If the user elects to <R>eply, sequential
         message type-out resumes with a repeat of the message to which
         the reply was entered.  User may press ENTER for a default to
         the "[N]ext" option.  (VAQ)
91Apr03  Added user configuration option to set the number of lines on
         the user terminal in order to activate a "-More-" prompt at the
         end of each terminal page during reading of long messages or
         formatted textfiles.  Configuration command is ".ECS" and
         it supports a range of 0 to 50 lines.  A value of 0, if
         selected, will defeat the "-More-" prompt and allow for
         "normal" continuous type-out.  Updated version of CONFG.MNU
         will be included with the V5.17 release file-sets, but can be
         just as easily generated locally.  (VAQ)
91Apr13  Minor modification to console output display in CITAGATE
         utility.  CITAGATE utility now released as Ver. 1.04, but
         Ver. 1.03 remains completely compatible.  No need to upgrade
         except for console display change.  (VAQ)
91Apr15  Added a <H>elp option to the prompt between messages for
         users configured to pause after each message.  Requires
         PAUSEMSG.BLB for full usage.  (VAQ)
91Apr28  Released Version 5.17.  (VAQ)
