89Feb15  Door code changed.  Citadel now comes down with exitlevel
         of FOUR (4) when user selects an active Door.  Main BBS
         batch-file must contain "IF ERRORLEVEL 4 GOTO <label>"
         to handle this.  The <label> section of the main batch
         file should move to the \homeArea\DOOR directory and
         then execute DOORNAME.BAT, which Citadel will create
         in that directory prior to coming down.  Each Door
         batch file must return to ROOTdir after finishing
         the Door, then call the main BBS batch file with
         a parameter of "+noinit".  This will cause Citadel
         to come back up, skipping the modem initialization
         section, and present the user with the BASEROOM
         prompt and await a re-login.  Current UART baudrate
         is passed via the file LASTUSER.SYS and is read by
         Citadel during the NOINIT reboot.  The purpose of this
         modification is to allow for more memory space during
         Door operations. (VAQ)
89Feb17  Added command-line parameter "+olddoor" for those who
         do not want to switch their door-handling methods to
         the new wiz-bang method!  This is probably just a
         temporary patch. (VAQ)
89Feb20  Added command-line parameter "+doors" which brings
         Citadel back up with NOINIT and also sets flags
         for kludgey reset at end of current online session. (VAQ)
89Feb22  Added command-line parameter "doormin=" to allow sysops
         to set the per-use time limit for those doors and door
         utilities controlled by DORINFO1.DEF instead of using
         a hardcoded time parameter in Citadel itself. (VAQ)
89Mar10  Added support for reading ZIPfile directories. (VAQ)
89Mar12  Added support for selectively downloading members of
         ZIPfiles using Ymodem or Zmodem.  Activating this
         facility is done by placing a file called UNZIP.SYS
         in the RoomArea directory (where DEARC.SYS already
         should reside) and putting the name of the "unZip"
         utility in that file.  Also, copy of Zip utility
         and Arc utility must reside in ROOT as "zipper.exe"
         and "archiver.exe" respectively.  Facilities have
         been tested using PKZIP.EXE as "zipper.exe" and
         PKARC.EXE as "archiver.exe."  Others *may work but
         these two are *known to work.  (VAQ)
89Mar12  Removed internal code for reading ARC directories
         and replaced it with a shell to "archiver.exe".
         This adds no memory overhead and reduced executable
         file size by about 1K in CTDL.EXE. (VAQ)
89Mar18  Disabled "General Maintenance" sysop command from the
         public runtime code.  In view of the function-key
         facilities supported, it was a superfluous command.  (VAQ)
89Mar19  Released Citadel:K2NE V4.06  (VAQ)
89Mar20  Time-slicing code written to make Citadel a bit easier
         to run under "multi-tasking" shells such as DesqView
         and DoubleDos.  (BBR)
89Mar21  Last caller to system, last caller's connect-speed and
         current status of Mail> flag pulled into CtdlTabl.Sys
         file.  LASTUSER.SYS no longer needed.  Code pulled.  (BBR)
<><><><><><><><> Start MAJOR VERSION 5.0 at this point <><><><><><><><><>
89Mar24  Encryption routines disabled and utility UNCRYPT.EXE written to
         decrypt files on an encrypted Citadel in order to convert
         to the "cleartext" version.  To compile without encryption
         use "-DNO_CRYPT" at compile-time.  (BBR)
89Mar27  Command ".RC" [read contents-of-packed-file] written to
         replace .RAD and .RZD command sequences.  Requires the
         use of public domain utility IFL.COM to read ZIP and
         ARC file contents from shell.  (VAQ)
89Apr02  Minor bugs repaired!  (VAQ)
89Apr03  Net_Switch headers suppressed except during mail routing
         functions, in accordance with the Joint Policy Statement
         and Agreement between Citadel:K2NE and STadel development
         groups.  (VAQ)
89Apr05  Citadel:K2NE Ver. 5.0 released.  (VAQ)
89Apr12  Minor bug-swatting!  Maintenance upgrade of Ver. 5.0
         released.  Also, some cosmetic changes to the reporting
         "style" in NETLOG file.  (VAQ)
89Apr22  Code added to show previous caller's name to current
         caller at login.  (VAQ)
89May28  Code added to display FIDODAY.HLP at login if present.
         Intent is to allow sysop to show the FIDOnet daily
         message summaries for active FIDO conferences.   Note
         that FIDOnet is NOT directly supported by Citadel, but
         must be utilized as a Door.  (VAQ)
89May29  Aide callers are given a "user level" of 5 for purposes
         of Doors such as SmlNet which support such things.  All
         other logged-in callers have a "level" of 2.  (VAQ)
89Jun25  Version 5.01 released.  (VAQ)
89Jun25  COLOR= and STATUS= added as command-line options to set
         screen (background/foreground) and statusline colors.
         This replaces the usage of the DOS environment to handle
         this stuff.  See any good DOS reference guide for color
         code numbers (or just play with it until you find a
         combination that you like).  Supports MDA, CGA, EGA
         and VGA monitor/card combinations.  (VAQ)
89Jul01  Screen FOREground color can now be incrmentally selected
         by use of F8.  Similary, screen BACKground color can be
         selected by F7.  If Citadel is restarted it will take the
         screen Fore/background colors from the settings of COLOR
         and STATUS in the batchfile (if any), defaulting to (0,0).  (VAQ)
89Jul03  Added support for handling "*.LZH" files of the type created
         by the Japanese file-archiving utility LHARC.EXE.  System
         now handles these in the same manner as *.ARC or *.ZIP files.
         Needed a new command, so ".RH" was utilized for "read LHARC..."
         options.  (VAQ)
89Jul05  Version upgraded to Version 5.02 for internal purposes.  (VAQ)
89Jul09  Net stabilization during AnytimeNet Receive streamlined by
         passing through the previously-determined baudrate of the
         incoming call.  Increment Net Version to 1.11.05 reflecting
         this enhancement.  Compatibility with older versions not
         diminished in any way.  Change is in SYSDEP1.C.  (VAQ)
89Jul15  Added "+fast" command-line option.  This will speed up sending
         command strings to the modem.  If the modem can handle these
         speeds, it saves 5 to 10 seconds during system startup and at
         networking time.  Works with Avatex-2400 series and probably
         most non-Hayes "Hayes compatibles".  For some odd reason, not
         all "real Hayes" modems can do this!  (VAQ)
89Jul22  Door-use privileges can now be linked to a user's possession
         of network privileges.  If you need this on your system to
         block a "door hog" you must compile the entire BBS using
         "-DTWIT" to define the "TWIT" variable in your makefile for
         CTDL.EXE.  When the code is compiled in this manner, a user
         will not be permitted access to any doors unless the user
         has network privs.  This has not been tested for "non-networking"
         node option.  Don't know if it works if you set up your Citadel
         as a non-networking system.  (VAQ)
89Jul24  Temporarily using the "`" key to display the network log from
         the "waiting for call" mode.  This will soon change to a function
         key.  (VAQ)
89Jul25  Linking of Door privs to Net privs is now done via command-line
         parameter "linkprivs" rather than method noted on 89Jul22.  (VAQ)
89Jul26  Citadel will now track the number of messages created by a user
         during a logged session and post it to the CALLLOG.SYS file at
         logout.  (VAQ)
89Sep03  F9 key is now used to read the network log from the console
         while system is waiting for incoming calls.  (VAQ)
89Sep03  RELEASE of Citadel:K2NE Version 5.03 for public use.  (VAQ)
89Sep12  System will now display SPECIAL.HLP at login if it exists.  (VAQ)
89Sep24  System will no longer look for DAYNOTES.BLB, FIDODAY.HLP or
         SPECIAL.HLP at login.  Instead, system looks for up to five
         ASCII files (named LOGTEXT.001 thru LOGTEXT.005) and displays
         them at login if they exist (search/display is numerically
         ordered by the file extension).  (VAQ)
89Oct19  System will no longer prompt for #Nulls at new user login.
         Default set to 0 for nulls.  Leave it up to the user to
         set it using ".ec".  (VAQ)
89Oct19  Added ".EL" (.enter local-only-message) command.  (VAQ)
89Oct21  Modified CHAT to ignore unlogged callers.  (VAQ)
89Oct24  Added "<L>ocal-only Save Message" at "Entry Cmd:" prompt.  (VAQ)
89Oct24  Added Door-privilege toggle to Sysop command set.  New users
         default to HAVING door privs when new account is created.  (VAQ)
89Oct24  Started work on using "logBuf.lbflags.lflag3" to handle
         flag for user's Door graphics level.  (VAQ)
89Oct25  Minor hack to show Door privs instead of linefeed status for
         the ".aqu" command.  (VAQ)
89Oct26  Added command-line param "nodoors" for sysops who want new users
         to default to NO door privs.  Leave this param out, and new
         accounts will HAVE door privs.  (VAQ)
