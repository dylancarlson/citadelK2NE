91Dec07  Released V6.02.  (VAQ)
92Feb02  Modified audio used with windowed reports.  (VAQ)
92Feb07  Removed function "fakeFullCase()".  Most folks are using
         terminals which support upper and lower case, and it should
         be left to the writer how a message should appear!  (VAQ)
92Mar07  Removed ability for Aide to read local or remote FIDO
         log activity.  It struck me that this was too "FIDO-specific"
         and would severely constrain future development.  Code is still
         in CTDL.C module for this, as are all referenced functions, since
         they will, in all probability, be used for other stuff down the
         line.  (VAQ)
92Jun15  Resumed work on code after house move!  (VAQ)
92Jul14  Modified display format of message totals at room-prompts.  (VAQ)
92Aug25  When a user is done visiting all rooms containing new messages,
         and upon returning to the base-room by the "G" command, Citadel
         will now print a message telling the user that all rooms have
         been checked and no new messages remain.  Local sysop can use
         ALLDONE.BLB in the help-area directory for a customized
         message if the default is not satisfactory. If user is in "expert"
         mode then the file ALLDONEX.BLB is used - if it exists.  (VAQ)
92Aug27  When a user is done "reading the system" and returns to the base-room,
         getting the message described in the 92Aug25 note, the user will
         now also get a prompt asking if he wants to log off the system.
         An affirmative answer will trigger the logoff routines.  (VAQ)
92Sep10  Code tested on different system to check for problems.
         Pre-release "shakedown" appears OK.  (VAQ)
92Sep12  Released V6.03  (VAQ)
