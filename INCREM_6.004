92Sep12  Released V6.03  (VAQ)
92Nov06  Began revision series for V6.04  (VAQ)
93Feb09  Added capability to run a batch-file when entering CONSOLE mode
         for sysop (or guest user).  When you press ESC to enter CONSOLE
         mode, Citadel will look for ONLOCAL.BAT and run it if it exists.
         When you <T>erminate your local console session, Citadel will
         look for OFFLOCAL.BAT and run it if it exists.  The purpose is
         to allow you to disable/enable a "watchkit" timer if you are
         using one.  Here at Jersey Devil, I use WATCHKIT to reboot the
         hardware if 2 hours go by without a caller, or if the line rings
         eight times without an answer (indicating that Citadel has gone
         into lala-land).  Unfortunately, such utilities can't read minds
         and if I used the system locally and someone was trying to call,
         on the eighth ring the hardware would reboot with me online.
         After being sufficiently annoyed by this, I devised this solution.
         My ONLOCAL.BAT file consists of the following:
               @echo off
               WATCH OFF >NUL
         My OFFLOCAL.BAT file consists of the following:
               @echo off
               WATCH TIMER >NUL
         The ">NUL" directs all screen output to the null device and avoids
         "messing up" Citadel's screen display.  (VAQ)
93Feb12  Aides at CONSOLE and remote sysops (with the password) can now
         edit the BaseRoom ("lobby").  Primarily intended for those
         sysops who want their BaseRoom to be "read only" or to be a
         directory room.  NETWORKING of the BaseRoom is NOT ENCOURAGED!  (VAQ)
93Feb21  Modified archive file contents display interpreter to recognize
         the latest (v2.04) PkZip releases.  (VAQ)
93Mar06  Added <B>ack as an option for those users pausing after each
         for a prompt.  Exact same function as "+/-" but some say it
         looks nicer, and I agree (thank you Steve Williams!).  (VAQ)
93Mar06  Modified FOSSIL interface to permit use of modems at 9.6, 14,4 and
         19.2 kbps.  Opened relevant variables in the CTDLCNFG overlay.
         Many thanks to Steve Williams ("Patriot") and Mike
         Burger ("FreakDog") for the loan of the modems required
         in order to test the routines!  (VAQ)
93Mar08  Room Descriptions are now supported.  When a user creates a room,
         the user will automatically be prompted to enter a description for
         the room.  Room descriptions can be read by pressing "I" at the
         room prompt.  If a description exists, Citadel will show it.  If
         not, then Citadel will ignore the request in a kindly manner.
         Descriptions can be edited by any Aide or remote Sysop.  Note also
         that if a room has a moderator, this will be displayed automatically
         as part of that room's <I>nformation.  This entire mess is auto-
         maintaining.  That means Citadel will take care of everything without
         burdening the Sysop with yet more meaningless file-maintenance
         chores.  You will see bunches of files in your HomeArea directory
         of the type "ROOMINFO.xx" where "xx" is a number (corresponding to
         the room-number to which the ROOMINFO file belongs.  These are flat
         ASCII files and could be edited by the sysop offline if so desired.
         This whole mess is the brainstorm of Steve Williams.  I don't know
         whether or not to thank him, though... Time will tell!  (VAQ)
93Mar09  Added code to support reading "verbose" modem messages.   This
         sidesteps the problem which results because not all high speed
         modems offer a numeric connect-code for a 14,400bps session.
         It also leaves the door open for future support of speeds higher
         than 19,200bps without requiring "coding magic."
            NOTE WELL: The NETWORKER still INSISTS on numeric codes, so in
            your #callOutPrefix statement, be sure to include a "V0" to put
            your modem into "numeric codes" mode.  (VAQ)
93Mar12  Citadel will now display number of messages left to read when
         user is configured to pause after each message.  Thanks to
         the QuartzFolk and the Patriot for nagging this one into the
         current release.  (VAQ)
93Mar13  Citadel will now display Floor name in brackets directly in
         front of room name, as in "[Main] Lobby>" instead of showing
		 floor name only when moving to new floor.  This display is only
         active for non-expert users and those in floor mode.  (VAQ)
93Mar15  Version 6.04 released.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)

********** Special Reference for Modem Control (string) settings ************

The following are the modem control strings in use at Jersey Devil Citadel.
These have been tested, and found to work, with the Zoom 14.4 FAXmodem,
the Supra 14.4 FAXmodem and the Compudyne (internal) 9642i modem.  We have
strong suspicion that these strings will work with virtually all currently
available high speed modems, however, you are left to your own devices.
The usual symptom(s) of incorrect settings are: lockup of system after
RING detect, failure to sync on networking in either direction.

It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you set your modem to send VERBOSE results.
Citadel WILL read them.  The "W2" statement in the #modemSetup string tells
our modem(s) to ONLY report "CONNECT xxxx" where "xxxx" is the DCE speed.
You MUST have your FOSSIL LOCKED at 19200bps for all this modemMagic to work!

#modemSetup "ATH W2 S25=1 S7=80 &C1 S2=255 E0 V1 X4 M1 S0=0 &D2 S36=7 S48=7 &Q5"
#modemReset "AT S0=0 S2=255 S36=7 S48=7 &Q5"
#modemIdle "AT S0=0 S2=255"
#modemAnswer "ATA"

#callOutPrefix "AT &Q6 S36=3 S48=128 V0 M1DT"
#callOutSuffix "\r"
