93May12  Version 6.07 released.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
93May21  Code tightening done on the Net_Switch code in K2NE.C,
         with no impact on the sysop or user interfaces.  (VAQ)
93May25  Time delay added to end-of-session disconnect during networking
         to avoid un-necessary "Remote host sent disconnect" messages
		 and to help eliminate confusing the Citadel-86 and Citadel-68
         networkers which false-errored, caused mainly by the increased
         efficiency of the FOSSIL-oriented modem routines we use.  (VAQ)
93May28  When system reboots after a crash/recovery the message announcing
         this event is no longer posted in the Aide room, but is placed
         in CALLLOG.SYS instead (+recover parameter must be used in the
         main BBS batch-file; see sample RUNBBS.BAT).  A blank line will
         be inserted into CALLLOG.SYS prior to the notation of the rebuilt
         file-system as a useful device to call attention to the event.  (VAQ)
93Jun04  In response to several requests we present here, a quick review on
         "How to set up DOORS for Citadel:K2NE"....

         Exerpt from our RUNBBS.BAT file:

ctdl rings=2 coltb=2,1,4,5,2 dead=15,2 noluck=3,7 doormin=%dr% %1
if ERRORLEVEL 4 goto doors

         The first important item is the "doormin=%dr%" parameter.  That
         "%dr%" is an ENVIRONMENT variable, dr, set by our autoexec.bat file
         and for DOORS to work, it should be AT LEAST 15.  It represents the
         MINUTES that a user is allowed to be in any one DOOR.

         Next is the "ERRORLEVEL 4" which simply means that when a user
         leaves Citadel to run a DOOR, Citadel will exit on ERRORLEVEL 4, so
         when this happens we jump to the portion of RUNBBS.BAT labelled
         "doors" as seen in the following:

:doors
c:
watch off
cd \k2ne\door
echo GOING TO DOOROPEN BATCHFILE NOW....
dooropen.bat

        When Citadel "comes down" we will be in the Citadel "home" directory
        which most folks call "k2ne".  Here, it is C:\K2NE.  Now, for doors
        to work, you MUST have a directory called DOOR "off of" your K2NE
        directory (here, it is C:\K2NE\DOOR).  Citadel will create the file
        called DOOROPEN.BAT, and that file will call your door by its number
        or letter in your DOOR.BLB file which is found in your \K2NE\HELPAREA
        directory.  For example, if your user chose to run Door #5, then
        DOOROPEN.BAT will run 5.BAT, which YOU MUST WRITE.  This batchfile
        will be different for each door you run.  Most "door programs" give
        you sample batchfiles to help you "build your own."  For your
        information, the program CTDLKEY.EXE MUST ALSO BE in your \K2NE\DOOR
        directory, because IT is the utility that will create your DORINFO1.DEF
        and PCBOARD.SYS files (these are used by the door programs themselves
        and not by Citadel).

        Finally, and VERY VERY VERY important, the LAST LINE of each of your
        individual DOOR batch files MUST be "RUNBBS +noinit".  This calls
        Citadel back to life after the user is done with the door, and the
        "+noinit" parameter tells Citadel to leave the modem alone since
        there is already a user online and a carrier present.

93Jun16 System will now show "Citadel" for the user's location when the
        user is in a hidden room (upon execution of the "@" command).  VAQ
93Jun18 Alternative method of generating user <P>rofiles implemented.  If
        you want the search for user profiles to be significantly faster,
        run CLOG >USERLOG.IDX and put USERLOG.IDX in your Citadel "home-
        area" directory.  USERBIO.EXE will then use USERLOG.IDX to find
        the user's log-record instead of "grepping" through the USER files.
        For a few users this will be slightly slower, for most it will be
        much faster, in all cases it will now, essentially, take the same
        time to generate and display the user PROFILE results.
        IMPORTANT - you MUST use the version of USERBIO.EXE included with
        Citadel:K2NE V6.08 in order to implement this method.  (VAQ)
93Jun23 Added built-in screen blanker.  Parameter "blanker=#" should be added
        to the RUNBBS batch file where CTDL is called.  If present, the
        screen will blank after "#" minutes of 'waiting for a call.'
        For example, "blanker=3" would blank the screen after 3 minutes
        of inactivity at the "call waiting" screen.  Any type of activity,
        from keyboard or modem, or upon initiation of an outbound net session,
        will restore the screen.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Jun28 Citadel now grabs user name, user status and date/time of user
        last call from LASTON.# file (where # is the log slot number of the
        user).  The file LOGDATES.SYS is no longer used and may be deleted.
        Code which tracks the number of previous calls made by a user was
        modified to reflect this change.  (VAQ, SMW)
93Jun28 Code for V6.08 released to beta-test sites.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
93Jul01 Version 6.08 released.  (VAQ, SMW, MAB)
